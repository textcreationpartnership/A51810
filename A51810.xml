            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Then <hi>Peter</hi> opened his mouth, and ſaid, Of a truth I
perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons: but in every nation, he that

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Chapter gives us the firſt account of the Apoſtles
Preaching the Goſpel unto, and Converſe with the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi>
amongſt whom, <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Houſhold are mentioned as a kind
of firſt Fruits of them, given in unto Chriſt. The whole Story is very
Remarkable; and many uſeful Inſtructions doth the Context and Coherence
offer to our conſideration; ſome few whereof it may may not be amiſs to
gather up, and <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33235:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>briefly to inſiſt upon, in our way
to the Text.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, its worthy our notice and conſideration,
who or what this <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> was, the Subject immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in
the Apoſtles Diſcourſe; ſince that the witneſs which he obtained of
God, touching his Acceptance of him, is the Foundation whereupon St.
<hi>Peter</hi> Preached Chriſts Death; unto his General Concluſion, or
Inference, That in every Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of that, the firſt Verſe gives us an account; and therein both
of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and exuberancy of the Grace and Goodneſs of God to
Sinners, even of <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Why, he was a <hi>Roman</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, a
<hi>Centurion, i. e.</hi> Captain of a Hundred Footmen, of the <hi>Italian</hi>
Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron or <hi>Cohorts,</hi> conſiſting of about Six hundred Men, and
which was the tenth part of a Legion. They were Heathen; nor was he himſelf
Proſelited to the <hi>Jews</hi> Religion (as is Evident in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of the
Diſcourſe) tho he might in that degenerate Age yet have help to light his
Candle from them. He lived in <hi>Ceſaria,</hi> a City of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
(the Scept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33235:5"/>being then departed from <hi>Judah</hi>), as
his Station allotted to him by the <hi>Roman</hi> Powers, to keep Gariſon
upon them, and to hold them in ſubjection; and what the Temper and Religion,
(or rapine rather) of ſuch Military Perſons ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily is, or hath been in
ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all the World knows.</p>
            <p>Now, it's not ſo much matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment, that in every
Nation, all that fear God ſhould be accepted of him; as this, that ſo
ſingular Humanity Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Charity, Piety, and true Devotion, ſhould to
ſuch a Degres be found in a perſon of ſuch a Nation, without God in the
World, devoted to Idolatry in a Stranger born to the Covenant of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;
his Place or Station alſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the diſadvantage of his
Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preponderating againſt it.</p>
            <p>Surely he was more than in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way indebted to the Grace
of God; no leſs than St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, who, tho a <hi>Jew</hi> in
Religion, yet being withal a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a Perſecutor, and Injurious, (an
inſtance of another kind), when called by the Grace of God, <hi>Gal.</hi>
1.5. He could not but ſpeak his reſentment of <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33235:6"/>it, as
ſuperabundant toward him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. as was the Mercy of God,
which thereupon he obtained of him, <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Now, as that ſo remarkable inſtance of the Grace and Mercy of
God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> was in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for type or exemplar ſake, as himſelf noteth; for a
pattern to them which hereafter ſhould believe to Life Everlaſting; to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all diſcouragement in any, in the like caſes, labouring under the
ſenſe of Heinous Guilt: So is this Inſtance of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
brought into Example, firſt to ſhew how that God out of any Nation,
Kindred, Quality, or Condition of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons otherwiſe, can ſelect a People
to himſelf, and Implant his Fear in their Heart; and then, that having ſo
done, he will never fail, be their outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances what they will, to
teſtify his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Character for Piety (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the
diſadvantages that lay in his way) ſummarily mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 2. will
fall in particularly hereafter to be handled.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:33235:6"/>
            <p>Gods ſpecial care in the mean while over him, whilſt he is
found in the way of his Duty, we have Exemplified, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 5. in his
directing an Angel in a Viſion to ſpeak to him, that he ſhould ſend for
<hi>Peter,</hi> that he might open unto him more fully the way of Salvation,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 11.14. which as yet he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in.</p>
            <p>But there was a <hi>Remora</hi> in <hi>Peters</hi> way, which
muſt be removed. He could not converſe with a <hi>Gentile;</hi> and ſuch
a one was <hi>Cornelius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The caſe thus ſtood: Time was, and that but now, that the
<hi>Jews</hi> were the only choſen People of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whilſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were no People of his. They were nigh unto him;
theſe afar off, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17. They were a People Holy to the Lord;
theſe a People common, and prophane, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15. They a peculiar
Covenant People, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. we <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> aliens to the
advantage thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. Conſequently they were nearer to
Salvation than we; compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively Salvation was of them, <hi>John</hi> 4.22.
whilſt we were without hope, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. beyond the Line, ſitting
in darkneſs, and <pb n="6" facs="tcp:33235:7"/>in the ſhadow of Death, <hi>Luk.</hi>
1.79. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. nor were there any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated to gather
in the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> then.</p>
            <p>This Difference, the Pious <hi>Jews,</hi> and even the Apoſtles
themſelves thought ſhould continue; yea and ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as that
they thought they might not Lawfully eat with a <hi>Gentile.</hi> This was a
common received opinion among them, and known to other Nations, as appears by
the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> her Reply to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 4.9. (tho
but of Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, that we find); how ſeverely did the
Apoſtles, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they of the Circumciſion contend with
<hi>Peter</hi> after this, about it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.2? they were of opinion,
that under the Meſſias, the <hi>Jews</hi> Church-State was to be continued
and enlarged; that men muſt turn <hi>Jews,</hi> or they could not be Saved;
that the gathering in of the People, muſt be unto them. Of this
perſwaſion was <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf as yet, till better inlightned,
<hi>v.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>It's true, multitudes of Prophecies were Extant in the Sacred
Records, of the gathering of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto Chriſt, 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33235:7"/>of whole Nations and Kingdoms of them: Such as ſpake of his
<hi>ſprinkling</hi> many Nations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.15. Of <hi>giving</hi>

23. <hi>That</hi> every man ſhould worſhip him from his place, even all the
Iſles of the Heathen, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.11. <hi>That</hi> God would call them
his people, that were not his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.10. And many Nations

            <p>But their Caſe was not much unlike to the <hi>Ethiopian
Eunuchs,</hi> Acts 8.31. they wanted an Interpreter; and no wonder, when the
Vail (if I miſtake not) is not yet done away on the minds of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of men, both learned and pious, in the reading of the Scriptures, which 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33235:8"/>ſpeak of the Kingdom of God, or of Chriſt here in this
World, or of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Church-State of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> whilſt not
doubting but that Salvation is of them, or that Gods Election runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them,
they yet interpret all the Scriptures (ſuch as theſe forementioned) of the
Myſtical Church State of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> or which yet is more wide,
would have them to ſpeak of a viſible Church-State only of the
<hi>Gentile</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or of their becoming only viſibly a People to the
Lord, ſo far as concern the whole bulk of the unregenerate; at leaſt or of
a Kingdom to be erected unto Chriſt, of viſible Saints, or of perſons in
viſibility, or in <hi>foro humano</hi> pious; which hath no footing at all in
the Scriptures; ſomething real doth <hi>ſub eſſe,</hi> reſpecting the
whole.</p>
            <p>To proceed in the Story.</p>
            <p>The time was now come, that the Wall of Partition between the
<hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> was to be broken down, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14.
All were to be gathered up under a new Head, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> no
longer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main afar off, as ſtrangers, <hi>v.</hi> 19. but to become
fellow Heirs, and of the ſame <pb n="9" facs="tcp:33235:8"/>body, <hi>ch.</hi> 3.6. Now
was <hi>Abraham</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Heir of the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. And the
<hi>Gentile</hi> Nations to be diſcipled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. and grafted in
amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> or in their room, into the <hi>Olive</hi> Tree, or
Covenant of <hi>Abraham;</hi> no longer neither they nor their Children to be
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted common or unclean, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. If
conſequently they embraced the Goſpel, they ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on even terms with
the <hi>Jew,</hi> in the point of Salvation as nigh as they; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
Converſation might be held with them in order to it; tho it was meet that the
<hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of the firſt tender, as they
had on the account of their antecedent covenant-relation to God, <hi>Acts.</hi>
3.25, 26. <hi>Job.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46 <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.6.</p>
            <p>This was a Myſtery which in other Ages was not made known unto
the ſons of men, as now it is, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.5, 9,
And here it was that <hi>Peter</hi> ſtuck, as was ſaid, notwithſtanding
the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of old, and laſt Inſtructions of Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi>
16.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.8. given to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; yet he could not get over
it; ſtill two things lay in his way; the one rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33235:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the external Ceremony of the Kingdom of God, which
he thought ſhould ſtill be confined to the narrow compaſs of one ſingle
Nation, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (little thinking, that the
Children of the Kingdom rather ſhould be ſhut out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12. or
the Kingdom of God ſhould be taken from them, and given to other Nations,
<hi>ch.</hi> 21.43.) Hence it was that he accounted it unlawful (as was ſaid)
to keep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with one of another Nation, <hi>v.</hi> 28. whereof eating was
a ſymbol alſo; or to preach the Goſpel to them; to the <hi>Jews</hi>
belonged the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the Promiſes,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and he doubted not of going unto the loſt Sheep of the
Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> tho o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wicked, but of giving the
chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Bread unto Dogs, or of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the ſheepfold unto the
<hi>Gentile</hi> Nations. The other Obſtacle in his way was a
prepoſſeſſion of mind, reſpecting the future ſtate of Perſons; he
doubted, it ſeems, of Gods acceptance of any of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto
Life Eternal; being ſtrangers to the advantages of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of
Promiſe, whereof the <hi>Jews</hi> 
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:33235:9"/>were the Heirs, whether
or no in any ſingle Inſtance, any one of them could be in favour with
God.</p>
            <p>The method which God took to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>Peter,</hi> was
extraordinary; the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whereof beginneth at <hi>ver.</hi> 9. he went up to
pray, about the ſixth Hour; that is, at noon-time, according to the
computation of the <hi>Jews;</hi> at which time being very hungry, while they
made ready, he fell into a Trance, and in a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he ſaw Heaven opened,
and a Veſſel deſcending unto him, wherein were all manner of Beaſts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Amongſt which were unclean meats, prohibited by the Law of
God for a <hi>Jew</hi> to eat of them; and yet there came a Voice to him,
Riſe <hi>Peter,</hi> kill and eat, <hi>v.</hi> 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this he regreted as a
thing which he had never done; but the Voice anſwered him again, <hi>What God
hath cleanſed, that call not thou common, v.</hi> 15. this being interpreted
to him, not only to relate unto meats, but unto men alſo, that he ſhould
not call any man common or unclean, <hi>v.</hi> 29. he was now fully
ſatisfied in his mind, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: However after this, through his
too much Condeſcention for Peace ſake, <pb n="12" facs="tcp:33235:10"/>or
prepoſterous fear of offence to ſome leading good people, he ſometimes
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled it, and led others into the ſame, for the which he received a
ſevere check from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Now was the Apoſtolical Commiſſion broken up, and opened
unto him; and the Viſion had been thrice doubled unto him for the more
Aſſurance; hereupon <hi>Peter</hi> forthwith goes to <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
taking along with him certain of the Brethren; whom <hi>Cornelius</hi> meeting,
fell down at his feet, <hi>v.</hi> 25. whom <hi>Peter</hi> firſt corrects for
his too much Worſhip or Reverence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto him, tho an Apoſtle or
Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, being but a man, <hi>v.</hi> 26. and then proceeds to
his diſcourſe: Firſt by way of Apology for himſelf, leſt
<hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> ſhould ſuſpect him to do what he did with an evil
Conſcience againſt the Law of God, or manner of the Fathers; he clears
himſelf by ſhewing his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Heaven for his coming unto him,
<hi>v.</hi> 28. which when <hi>Cornelius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had confirmed by the
like Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny recited by him, and declared with what earneſt expectation
they were there met before God, to hear what Meſſage <pb n="13" facs="tcp:33235:10"/>it
was that he had commanded him of God to deliver unto him; <hi>Peter</hi> goes
on directly to the matter in the Words of the Text: Which Words contain a
general Inference from what goes before, and are but introductory unto what he
immediately ſubjoins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then Peter opened his mouth;</hi> which Phraſe of Speech in
Scripture importeth much ſeriouſneſs in the delivery of ſome weighty
matter; <hi>and</hi> he <hi>ſaid, Of a truth I perceive;</hi> now I do
aſſuredly underſtand. What was that he was ſo clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of?
Why, <hi>that God is no</hi> accepter or <hi>reſpecter of perſons:</hi> but
in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, or to what purpoſe is he not ſo? Why, in the point of
acceptance unto Life: <hi>But in every nation</hi> ſaith he, be they
<hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> Circumciſed or not, <hi>he that feareth
him, and worketh Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is accepted with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's the latter part, contained in <hi>v.</hi> 35. that I have
deſigned mainly to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore ſhall but briefly touch
upon the opening of the former in our way, to give light thereunto: Nor need
there much to be added to what hath already been ſpoken, for the
underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="14" facs="tcp:33235:11"/>of the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, or for
the confirmation of the Truth by him inferred and aſſerted in thoſe
Words, <hi>That God is no reſpecter of perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reſpect of Perſons muſt relate to ſomething as the
Reaſon or Motive, and that may be either ſomething of <hi>Internal</hi>
Qualification in the Subject, or of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick</hi> difference of State
or Condition.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a double Reſpect of God unto men, in the
communication of his Goodneſs to them, to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That of his proviſion of a Remedy for Mankind in
general, in his counſel of peace, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13. And giving of his Son
unto death for them, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. Opening unto
lapſed man a door of hope, whilſt the Angels fallen, were paſſed by,
<hi>v.</hi> 16. And the conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal grant of acceptance unto all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
by the Goſpel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. This in the whole contrivance thereof was
without all reſpect of perſons <hi>abſolutely, i. e.</hi> without regard
unto any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or within them lovely, as the reaſon thereof: Yea,
Mankind, <hi>ut in eſſe cognito,</hi> were all alike conſidered, as
Enemies <pb n="15" facs="tcp:33235:11"/>and Rebels, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 8. No foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was left for it. So likewiſe for his communication of Grace unto this or that
particular perſon: However God hath conſtituted a Law about it,
<hi>haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti dabitur, Matt.</hi> 25.27, 29. Laid out the ordinary method of it,
and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the means, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.27. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.4, 5 ſo as
to leave all men without excuſe that have it not, to be caſt by the
Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; yet hath he reſerved to himſelf the prerogative of a
<hi>Superſedeas,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the ſame to whom he pleaſes; and
this is founded in his <hi>Dominion,</hi> without all reſpect of perſons:
It was Typ't by Gods Election of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> without all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to
be a people to himſelf, when no better than any other people of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.2, 3, 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.2. <hi>Was not Eſau Jacobs
Brother, ſaith the Lord, yet I loved Jacob, and I hated Eſau, and laid his
Mountains waſt:</hi> As there is the Dominion of Providence, ſo is there
the Dominion of Grace <hi>irreſpective,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation whereof belongs
to Gods Will of <hi>purpoſe</hi> only, not of <hi>precept:</hi> VVhen men
have forfeited the Grace of God, what now if God will do more for one 
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33235:12"/>than for another, as in the Inſtance of <hi>Saul</hi> and
his Companions, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.3, 14. what wrong to any? May he not do what he
will with his own, in a matter of bounty, Matt. 20.13, 15? <hi>Moreover whom he
did predeſtinate, them he alſo called, Rom.</hi> 8.30. ch. 9.11, 15.
<hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to
our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1.9. what tho there be nothing Antecedently lovely in the creature,
abſolutely conſidered, for God to have regard to? <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. yet
may God make a perſon lovely; to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6, 8.
<hi>when thou waſt in thy Blood, I ſaid unto thee, live. Behold thy time
was the time of love.</hi> Why may he not make a difference where he finds
none? This is the moſt abſolute irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective effect of Divine Love,
without all motive or reaſon taken from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on whom it is
terminated. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho it be not that meant in the Text, yet doth it not carry
any the leaſt contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto it, as ſome would have it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is yet another Reſpect of God unto men, and that
is, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his Complacential Love, <pb n="17" facs="tcp:33235:12"/>and
the effects of it unto them, in their acceptance to favour and life. And this
is it of which the Text ſpeaks. And this is without all reſpect of
perſons too, in a limited ſenſe; but not as before for, here God has a
ſpecial regard to the qualification of the ſubject, or his Grace in the
Soul, and has obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereunto, without diſcrimination. And for
that very reaſon is he here ſaid to be no reſpecter of Perſons; for
that in every Nation, in whomſoever true Piety is to be found, ſuch
perſons ſhall be ſure to find acceptance with him, as the next words do
explain it.</p>
            <p>The genuine ſenſe of the Apoſtles aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion then is
this, In whomſoever the Eſſence of true Piety is, and the fruits of it,
let him be of what Nation he will, (for that is his own inſtance) be he
<hi>Jew,</hi> (a <hi>Jew,</hi> imported a covenant people) or <hi>Greek,</hi>
God reſpects not that; let him be Bond or Free, Noble or Ignoble, Poor or
Rich; yea, Circumciſed or Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, let his outward Condition or
Religious Advantages be what they will be, or Diſadvantages, ſtill without
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons on any ſuch ſcore, he <pb n="18" facs="tcp:33235:13"/>ſhall
be accepted with God. If the old Man be put off, and the new Man be put on; why
then, <hi>there is there neither</hi> Greek <hi>nor</hi> Jew,
<hi>Circumciſion nor Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> Barbarian, Scythian, <hi>bond
nor free, but Chriſt is all and in all;</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is accepted in
him. Col. 3.10, 11. <hi>If the uncircumciſion,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
(and there the ſtick was) <hi>keep the righteouſneſs of the law, ſhall
not it be counted for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion?</hi> Rom. 2.26. <hi>He is a</hi> Jew
<hi>that is one inwardly, and circumciſion is that of the heart,</hi> v. 29.
ſuch a one was <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> inwardly, though a
<hi>Gentile</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and conſequently no Bar could lie in the way of
his acceptance with God. But what advantage then hath the <hi>Jew?</hi> The
objection the Apoſtle puts <hi>ch.</hi> 3.1. and anſwereth, <hi>v.</hi> 2.
much every way in the point and means he grants it; but not ſo as if no other
were capable of Salvation; that he denies, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then when Circumciſion was
in force, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Circumciſion availeth nothing, nor
uncircumciſion, but a new creature. And as many as walk according to this
rule, peace be on them, and mercy,</hi> Gal. 6.15, 16. without reſpect at all
of perſons, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <pb n="19" facs="tcp:33235:13"/>than as they are differenced by
the new Creature.</p>
            <p>Yet farther to clear up this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Word here
uſed in the <hi>Greek,</hi> is a Word of Aſſiſe, as is noted by the
Learned, and is Denominated of Judges, who are then Termed Reſpecters of
Perſons, when in Judgment they have regard to any thing but the Equity of the
Cauſe; when reſpecting the Face, and overlooking the Cauſe,
<hi>Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus inaequalia tribuuntur,</hi> right is not done, the cauſe is
commended for the perſon ſake, and not the perſon for the cauſe. And
this is it which <hi>Peter</hi> denies of God. How groſly then are they
miſtaken, who would make this to be one Eſſential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the
firſt and ſecond Covenant, That in the former, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance began at the
Work, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Perſon; but in or under the later, the
Perſon is firſt accepted, and thereupon the Work: that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſaith,
Do this and Live, the later, Live and do this. Contrary to the whole Currant of
Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17,
27, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.25. 
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33235:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. Making the Command of Chriſt
to the Young man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17. to be exploratory only, to try him; as
likewiſe the Declaration made by God unto <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>If
thou do well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> As if he meant not one word as
he ſaid to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13.</p>
            <p>Gods Love of <hi>Complacency,</hi> Favour, and Acceptance, has its
riſe in his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative</hi> Rigteouſneſs and Juſtice; is
regulated by his ſtanding Law, in its Goſpel <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, equity;
and is diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>judicially.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence, look as on the one hand, God abhorreth that his Damning of
any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be reſolved into meer <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Is God
unrighteous,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>when he taketh vengeance?
Abſit!</hi> God forbid: how then ſhall he Judg the World? <hi>Rom.</hi>
3.5, 6. No! it's a Juſt Recompence of Reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2. a Revelation
of the Righteous Judgment of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. So on the other hand, in
ſaving any one, <hi>he will render to every man according to his deeds: to
them who by patience continue in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeek for Glory, to them eternal
life,</hi>

<hi>Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord
the Righteous Judg ſhall give me at that day, and not to me only,</hi> 2
<hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. the free Gift of God indeed it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23 but
withal, <hi>quoad or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem conferendi,</hi> it's the reward of
Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. And as the <hi>Remunerative</hi> Righteouſneſs of God,
(with a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of Mercy too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1.16, 18. for ſtill we are ſinners) is concerned in the conſtitution of

thereof (as ſupream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World, and final Judg there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
concerned, that his favour and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance be equally diſpenſed, (in the

Religious or Civil. <hi>Knowing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that
whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the

            <p>Now we are come to the main point conſiderable in St.

<hi>Jubile,</hi> for the manumiſſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, termed the acceptable
year of the Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Abraham</hi> was called <hi>the
friend of God;</hi> and that involved within it, his Juſtification,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 2.23. and this compriſed the whole of what St. <hi>Paul</hi>
laboured after, that whether preſent, or abſent, clothed with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or
out of it, that he might be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. and <hi>he
it is that worketh us for the ſelf ſame thing, v.</hi> 5. and for all the
Glorious Effects of it <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us
meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</hi> Col. 2.12.
nothing more is required to make meet, for one, than for the other.</p>
            <p>The deſcription of the Subject, who they are, that without all
diſcrimination do and ſhall partake of this great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, is it which I
deſign more fully to dwell upon.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:33235:16"/>
            <p>The Character here given of a Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon accepted with God, is one,
the moſt juſt, full comprehenſive, and indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, in the whole Book
of God. And every Souls Concernment it is to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitouſly inquiſitive
about it. It's the only true Wiſdom, <hi>Job</hi> 28.12, 28.</p>
            <p>The ſame is Reduced in the Text un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Heads. (1.) A Fearer
of God. (2.) A Worker of Righteouſneſs. Each of which we ſhall ſpeak
particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with regard to <hi>Cornelius</hi> all along, the Samplar
which the Apoſtle had in his Eye, for the contribution of light unto our
enquiry.</p>
            <p>Some Interpreters do expound the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of ſound Piety, and
true Religion toward God. The later, of unſpotted Integrity, Equity, and
Juſtice toward Man: in Conformity to the two great Commands, <hi>to love God
with all the heart, and our Neighbour as our ſelf; on which two, hang all the
law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> Mat. 22.40. Or in the general, I chuſe rather to
Interpret the former, of Internal Religion, or Veneration paid to God in the
Heart; and the latter, of the exterior overt acts thereof, whether
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting <pb n="25" facs="tcp:33235:16"/>God or man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.2. which in
the iſſue comes much to the ſame. However, the particular handling of
both Branches, will fully let us into the underſtanding of the meaning of the
whole.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed, there lies a double objection in our way,
which muſt be removed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How <hi>Cornelius</hi> (or any one in his
Circumſtances) could be ſaid to be a Pious Man, on a true Fearer of God;
when as yet he had not imbibed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, nor had any
expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit belief of Chriſt; as it is Evident that he had not, nor yet his
Houſhold?</p>
            <p n="2">2. How he could in the mean while be accepted of God,
without Faith in the Mediator, (or his Prayers) conſidering alſo the hint
which himſelf received from God, that he ſhould ſend for <hi>Peter, who
ſhould tell him words whereby he and all his houſe ſhould be
ſaved?</hi> mentioned, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.14.</p>
            <p>I would willingly wave what is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, in ſo practical
a Subject; but the Text muſt be cleared. Beſides that <pb n="26" facs="tcp:33235:17"/>whatſoever is written, is for our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the
ſlighting, and paſſing over whatever ſeems difficult at firſt, in the
opening of the Scriptures, do but betray men to perpetual ignorance in the
things of God.</p>
            <p>One Anſwer will ſerve to both Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. Without Faith it's
impoſſible to pleaſe God, or be accepted with him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. or
to be a Pious Perſon. True! but the Faith neceſſary thereunto hath been
diverſified according to the ſeveral Editions of the Goſpel, and Gradual
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations made by God of his mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man. <hi>Cornelius</hi> had the
Faith there deſcribed by the A poſtle, which was the Faith of the Ancient
<hi>Patriarchs:</hi> Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the belief that God is, and that he is the
rewarder of them that diligently ſeke him.</hi> Nor can any one come unto God
without it. He came to God, as Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Merciful, and Pardoning ſin,
and as a Rewarder of all that uprightly ſerve him; on the Principles that the
King and People of <hi>Nineveh</hi> went, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.5, 9. tho he knew
not diſtinctly on what account, on whoſe ſcore it was, that God was ſo
propitious.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:33235:17"/>
            <p>Never was any man Heard, Saved, or Accepted, but for the ſake of
the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Merits of Chriſt. But what on mans part was
abſolutely neceſſary to be known unto him, or believed by him, in order
to his actual participation of the Benefit of the undertaking of Chriſt, is
another queſtion. The ſame hath been oft-times varied. The Rule of Gods
Final Judgment ſhall be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying Law, or new Covenant with all Men; but
ſtill according to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral notices, or diſcoveries, that in
ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages, and to ſeveral Perſons, he hath made of the ſame to
them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12, 14, 17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48.</p>
            <p>Nor can there remain any matter of wonder or doubt, touching this
Inſtance of <hi>Cornelius</hi> his acceptance with God, unto any one that
ſhall but impartially think upon the Faith of the Apoſtles and Diſciples
of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how ſhort and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective it was in the main Fundamentals of
the Chriſtian Belief for a time; whilſt yet they were in a ſtate of
Salvation for all that; notwithſtanding the advantages they had moreover to
know more, above what <hi>Cornelius</hi> had. They looked for 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33235:18"/>ſome viſible outward Kingdom to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by him in
the World, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. to be ſet up under the Meſſias,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 19.11. they thought not that he was to die, <hi>Matth.</hi>
16.22. <hi>ch.</hi> 17.23. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.32. nor believed his Reſurection
from the Dead, <hi>v.</hi> 10. not after it was atteſted, <hi>John</hi>
20.25, 29. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.20, 21, 25, 37, 41. much leſs did they think of
his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention to the right hand of the Father. How little did the Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf underſtand of Chriſt her Son according to the
Fleſh, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.50, 51. yea how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did the Angels, or glorified
Spirits, know of Chriſt his Prieſtly Office, before his Incarnation? 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15. the full
underſtanding of which Myſtery, was much more hid from former Ages,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. no inſtance we have of their putting up Prayers to God in
the Name of a Mediator, before the aſſumption of the Humane Nature by
Chriſt, in which he was a middle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe
alſo in me,</hi> John 14.1. <hi>The way into the holieſt of all was not yet
fully made manifeſt,</hi> Heb. 9.8. <hi>ch.</hi> 10.20. whence was the
<hi>bondage</hi> ſtate, even of the <hi>Jews. Hitherto have ye 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33235:18"/>asked nothing in my name,</hi> Joh. 14.24.</p>
            <p>Whether or no there be any now in the World, out of the Church,
that have not heard of Chriſt, that are ſtrangers to the Covenant in its
peculiar advantages now under the laſt edition of the Goſpel, that be true
fearers of God, (the Candle of the Lord being ſo far extinct among them,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.22. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16.) may be a doubt; but whether if
any ſuch there be, they ſhall be accepted with God, cannot be doubted:
<hi>Cornelius</hi> was ſuch a one; the Faith that he had, purified his Heart,
and influenced his Life, and he was accepted of him; tho his Faith was ſhort
of what was neceſſary to his Salvation afterward, when he had more revealed
unto him, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.14.</p>
            <p>Two great Truths are in this our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry cleared up by the way,
to this day hid unto many good men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Faith preciſely in the Brieftly Office of
Chriſt, is not the <hi>only</hi> condition of our Juſtification in the
ſight of God. Nor is it truly ſaid, that ſuch Faith <hi>alone</hi>
juſtifieth, and muſt ſo do; for that it's alone apt to receive Chriſt,
and that no <pb n="30" facs="tcp:33235:19"/>other Grace is capable of ſuch an
Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>True it is, that we are juſtified by Chriſt <hi>alone,</hi> as
the <hi>meritorious</hi> cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. But beſides
that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do indiſpenſibly require now more of us, to the end
that we may be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, than Faith only; namely, Repentance,
<hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. Regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. And an upright
Converſation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. Yea, denies it to Faith
<hi>only, Jam</hi> 2.24 Beſides this I ſay, then muſt the truth
aſſerted in the Text be quite overturned; for <hi>Cornelius</hi> was ſo
far from being juſtified by ſuch Faith alone, that he was juſtified
before he had it, or without it, or he was not juſtified or accepted at all;
now, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle affirmed it of him, ſome other Grace was capable of
being the condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; or he muſt be utterly uncapable of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Yet farther; then is Juſtification, or Acceptance with
God (for it's all one thing meant) a continued act, ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill on
the future performance of the commands of God, whatever God hath or ſhall
reveal to be his VVill. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> 
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:33235:19"/>was actually in
a ſtate of Favour with God, ſo ſaith the Text: But yet if upon
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Preaching unto him, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced not the Faith of the Goſpel
with his Houſhold, neither he nor they could be ſaved, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. No,
man is but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally pardoned and admitted unto Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God here;
it's ſuſpended ſtill with an <hi>If,</hi> and <hi>Except;</hi> it will
not be queſtioned in the matter of Faith, which was <hi>Cornelius</hi> his
caſe; and <hi>vice verſa,</hi> it's as ſure, and as plainly affirmed in
the VVord of God, in the matter of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in all other Inſtances of it:
Let a Mans Faith be what it will, ſuppoſe him once juſtified too, Gods
complacential Love and Favour, or Acceptance to Life, is ſtill ſuſpended
on his future continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in obedience unto what he knows to be his Will, or
may to him be yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revealed ſo to be, tho the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its ſelf
be already finiſhed. <hi>If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in my
love, John</hi> 15.10, 14. <hi>If we walk in the Light, as God is in the Light,
the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1
<hi>John</hi> 1.7 ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. <hi>ch.</hi> 8.13.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:33235:20"/>
            <p>And in as much as ſo great weight is laid upon the meſſage
ſent by <hi>Peter</hi> from God unto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> termed Words by
which he and all his Houſe ſhould be ſaved; that is, if attended unto,
believed, and embraced, as we have it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, in a parallel
Inſtance, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. It might be very pertinent in our way, firſt to
open what that meſſage did contain and import; but that it would prove too
long a digreſſion from what we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; yet I can't wholly paſs
it over neither, becauſe what was laſt propoſed unto him to be believed
and recelved, as ever he would be ſaved, is firſt to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto by
us, as the leading condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel now; yea it began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to be
perillous to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Houſhold to be ignorant of Chriſt
<hi>That word,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, you know, which was publiſhed
throughout all Judea, v.</hi> 37. The ſame with us, all muſt needs have
heard of, and he that believeth it, ſhall be ſaved; that is, <hi>coeteris
paribus,</hi> other things alike anſwering, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. (<hi>And he
that believeth not, ſhall periſh,</hi> Joh. 8.24.) <hi>Who by him do belive
in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. This Narrative of his unto
<hi>Cornelius</hi> and <pb n="33" facs="tcp:33235:20"/>the reſt, met together with him,
begins <hi>v.</hi> 36. and ends <hi>v.</hi> 43.</p>
            <p>And the ſame containeth a ſummary collection of their
<hi>credenda,</hi> or chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian Belief, contained in
our Creed, the like whereof we have again, <hi>ch.</hi> 13.23. to <hi>v.</hi>
39. Let me but mention the Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He declareth unto them the <hi>Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Chriſt,
or his anointing to his ſacred Offices, both of Prieſt, Prophet, and King,
<hi>v.</hi> 38. the execution of his Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal Office he chiefly deſigneth
to open; he is alſo Lord of all, <hi>v.</hi> 36. by him peace was preached,
by him it was obtained, and he was anointed thereunto, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How he was Crucified: <hi>Whom they ſlew, and hanged on
a Tree, v.</hi> 39. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on
the Tree,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. in our Room, <hi>ch.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he was <hi>raiſed</hi> up by God from the dead,
the Third day, <hi>v.</hi> 40. <hi>Who was delivered for our Offences, and was
raiſed again for our Juſtification, Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>And he ſhewed
himſelf openly to <pb n="34" facs="tcp:33235:21"/>witneſſes, choſen before of God,
even to us who did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the dead,
v.</hi> 41. Who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be miſtaken, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is he that is <hi>ordained</hi> of God to be the
Judg of quick and dead, <hi>v.</hi> 42. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all judgment unto the Son, John</hi> 5.22. This, ſaith he, we are
commanded to teſtifie; and then he concludeth with the ſuffrage of all the
Prophets, <hi>That through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall
receive Remiſſion of ſins, v.</hi> 43. that is, who <hi>aſſents</hi>
unto what he had dellvered to them, as a faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<hi>embraces</hi> it as worthy of all acceptation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. Termed
a believing in him; or <hi>receiving</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus the Lord,
<hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. for faith is in the will alſo, <hi>John</hi> 5.40.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the words, or the ſum of them, which <hi>Peter</hi>
delivered in that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; God was now manifeſted in the fleſh, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And it was the deſign of God the Father, that he ſhould
have the Honour of his Redemption of man; and that every Knee ſhould bow to
him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. Therefore as God ordered <pb n="35" facs="tcp:33235:21"/>it, that
by <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla, Apollos</hi> ſhould be inſtructed
in the way of the Goſpel more perfectly, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.26. So by his
ſpecial Diſpenſation was <hi>Cornelius</hi> directed unto <hi>Peter,</hi>
to give him light into the former rudimental Principles of the Doctrine of
Chriſt, that he might know the way of Salvation more fully, and his preſent
obligation in order to it. <hi>In whom ye alſo trusted, after that ye heard
the Word of Truth, the Goſpel of your Salvation, Eph.</hi> 1.13. So they,
<hi>While Peter ſpake theſe words, the Holy-Ghoſt fell on them,</hi> v.
44. <hi>and they were baptized in the name of the Lord,</hi> v. 48. Now was the
Character of <hi>Cornelins</hi> compleated, and his acceptance with God
confirmed to him, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. Nor can any one with us now be termed a
true fearer of God, but the Faith of Chriſt muſt be preſuppoſed unto
it; to which add the fear of God, and working Righteouſneſs, and it makes
up the full Character of a Perſon accepted with him: Which two Branches
(having cleared our way), we ſhall now proceed to the more diſtinct opening
of them each in particular.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:33235:22"/>
            <p n="1">1. To begin with the former: <hi>But in every Nation he that
feareth him,</hi> that is, God; he alone is the Object of all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fear;
and the fear of him here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the very eſſence of true Piety: <hi>This
do, and live,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſeph, for I fear God. Haſt thou
conſidered my ſervant Job, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and an upright man, one that feareth
God, and eſcheweth evil,</hi> ch. 1.8. It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculateth or initiateth into
the power of Religion: <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom,
and the knowledg of the holy, is underſtanding,</hi> Prov. 9.10. A
<hi>devout</hi> man, <hi>Cornelius</hi> is termed, <hi>v.</hi> 2. (ſtill we
muſt have an eye to him) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> it is a pious godly man; the
ſame Character with that of <hi>Annanias,</hi> who opened <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Eyes, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.12. Devoted to Godlineſs, as the Word is Tranſlated,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. The ſame with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Word peculiar to
the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which becometh Women profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Godlineſs, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. And one that feareth God, is but <hi>exegetical</hi> of the
former, it imports the ſame thing. More particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Fear of God imports the whole of his Worſhip, and
is ordinarily <pb n="37" facs="tcp:33235:22"/>put for it: <hi>The children</hi> of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the Lord their God, and had ſeared
other Gods. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.7. That is, had worſhipped or ſerv'd them;
and <hi>their fear towards me, is taught by the precept of men, i. e.</hi>
their Worſhip, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. <hi>So ſhall your Children make our
Children ceaſe from fearing the Lord, Joſh.</hi> 22 25. The worſhip of
the true God, and that according to his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, enters the
Character of a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of him: <hi>And Jacob ſware by the fear of his Father
Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 31.53. That is, the Eternal God whom his Father
worſhipped, <hi>v.</hi> 42. And this act of his was an Inſtance of his own
Fear of the ſame God: He ſware by the Lord only; not by the Gods of
<hi>Laban,</hi> or by the Lord, and by <hi>Malcham, Zeph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Him
only ſhalt thou fear. Thou ſhalt fear the Lord by God, him ſhalt thou
ſerve, and to him thou ſhalt cleave, and ſwear by his name,</hi> Deut.
10.20. Him ſhall ye fear, worſhip, and do Sacrifice to, 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
17.36. VVhat is the baſis or foundation of this fear or VVorſhip, which God
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth <hi>de novo;</hi> from lapſed man, to be paid unto him, the
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> gives us an <pb n="38" facs="tcp:33235:23"/>account of; <hi>But there
is forgiveneſs, that thou mayest be feared,</hi> Pſal. 130.4. It lies in
the diſcovery of Forgiveneſs with God, or that he is a rewarder thereof:
The entrance of ſin had laid man under the curſe, and ſo unhinged all.
<hi>Adam and his wife hid themſelves</hi> (to no purpoſe neither) <hi>from
the preſence of the Lord God,</hi> Gen. 3.8. It was the revelation of
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy, that retrieved and brought back again the fear of God, or his
wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip into the world: Take away the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of that; namely, that
God is placable, and there is no foundation of hope, or encouraging motive left
for ſervice or obedience for the future: If any of the ſons of men were
left as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs as the Devils, why then God would not expect this fear
from them; the belief of the contrary is the very firſt notion that God
requireth our aſſent unto, next to his Being, in all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us,
be would not have received a burnt-offering at our hands,</hi> Judg. 13.23. It
was a good Argument; the very <hi>preſcription</hi> of worſhip to fallen
man, is a moſt ſure Indication, that he <pb n="39" facs="tcp:33235:23"/>will deal with
him upon new terms of Mercy.</p>
            <p>This was the Faith of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and that which induced
him unto the fear of God, whilſt as yet he little underſtood, that without
the Blood of God there is no remiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. Or that the
Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the only way to it.</p>
            <p>And are not they near as wide from the truth of the Goſpel, who
admitting the Death of Chriſt to enter the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Grant of Forgiveneſs,
would limit his Sacrifice only to the Elect; ſaying, that he obtained not
remiſſion for any more, on any terms? VVhat hath been ſaid, carrieth in
it a demonſtration to the contrary, and reflects light into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of
the Death of Chriſt. It's moſt certain, that God hath preſcrited his fear
unto every ſinner; and as certain it is, that he expects no love, fear, or
new Obedience from them, who antecedently thereunto, can have no particular
aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that there is any forgiveneſs or acceptance with God for
them; much leſs would he exact of them to believe it, if it were not ſo, or
thereupon to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom <pb n="40" facs="tcp:33235:24"/>their ſervice, or to return unto him
on that ſuppoſition. Either then Chriſt, <hi>by the grace of God did
taste death for every man,</hi> Heb. 2.9. <hi>pro ſingulis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerum:</hi> or
there is not forgiveneſs with God for them, (which yet was the Faith of
<hi>Cornelius,</hi> (as ſhort as it was) that he might be feared: or we
muſt ſay, that there is forgiveneſs with him for ſome men, without
reſpect to Chriſt; or a Conditional Covenant grant thereof unto them, never
Ratified by, or Founded in his Blood; which is not the Chriſtian Belief. This
then is the firſt ſenſe to be underſtood of the fear of God; it's to
pay Worſhip and Homage unto him; nor can the fear of God be without it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It imports further, an awe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of his Divine
Majeſty, reaching the mind and affections. <hi>Sanctify the Lord of Hosts
himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread,</hi> Iſa.
8.13. <hi>Fear ye not me, ſaith the Lord? will ye not tremble at my
preſence?</hi> Jer. 5.22. <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly
of his Saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him,</hi>
Pſal. 89.7. <hi>let all <pb n="41" facs="tcp:33235:24"/>the earth fear the Lord, and let
all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the world ſtand in awe of him, Pſal.</hi> 33.8.
<hi>ſtand in awe, and ſin not,</hi> meaneth not a bare dread of his wrath,
a meer paſſion, or fright, or anguiſh of conſcience, reſpecting the
guilt or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſome atrocious ſin, or wickedneſs: This may ſerve
to reſtrain, or to impel to ſome partial acknowledgment of God; but
ſerves not to any heart-change. <hi>They feared the Lord, and ſerved their
own Gods,</hi> 2 King 17.33. <hi>unto this day they fear not the Lord,</hi> v.
34. that is, aright. No! they were none of thoſe that tremble at the
commandment of God, as it's ſaid, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.3.</p>
            <p>It imports a tenderneſs of Heart. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy Heart was
tender,</hi> 2 Chr. 34.27. <hi>How ſhall I do this thing, and ſin againſt
God?</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſeph.</hi> It's an habit of mind and Soul,
diſpoſing to an aweful regard unto God, averſation unto ſin, and
jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of offending him. The affections are the Wings and Feet of the
Soul; and have need to be ballanced with the awe of God, in order to its flight
from ſin. <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the latter
days,</hi> Hoſ. 3.5. In a Pious <pb n="42" facs="tcp:33235:25"/>Soul, this fear hath in
it a Contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Love. It's no <hi>Bondage</hi>-fear, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1.7. It's Conjugal; without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement. So far as Love is perfected, it caſts
out tormenting fear, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. it brings into the liberty of the
Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your
faces, that ye ſin not,</hi> Exod. 20.20. <hi>Fear not; yet fear and love
him, Deut.</hi> 10.12. Neither yet doth this filial fear of God, Exclude the
fear of everlaſting Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him, in caſe, or on the
ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Covenant breach, or preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous finning againſt
him. <hi>Fear him who is able to destroy both ſoul and body in Hell,</hi>
ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Let us ſerve
him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Godly fear, for our God is a conſuming fire,</hi>
Heb. 12.29. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the
ſpirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the Temple of God, him
ſhall God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16, 17. <hi>the fleſh lusteth against the
ſpirit,</hi> Gal. 5.17, <hi>now the works of the fleſh are manifest;</hi>
of which he gives a Catalogue, <hi>v.</hi> 19. of the <pb n="43" facs="tcp:33235:25"/>which, ſaith he, <hi>I tell you before, as I have told you alſo in
time paſt, that they that do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the kingdom of
God, v.</hi> 21. <hi>nor of Christ,</hi> Eph. 5.5. To be ſure, what ever God
threats, it behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every Pious Man to fear. <hi>Be not high minded, but
fear,</hi> Rom. 11.20. let him that ſtandeth do ſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10.12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Obj.)</hi> But it's here Objected by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, That all this is
the voice of the Law of Works; that ſuch threats belong not to believers;
only that of Fatherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement, in caſe they ſin. <hi>If his
children forſake my law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will viſit their
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion with the rod; my loving-kindneſs will I not utterly take
from him.</hi> Pſal. 89.30. how then can the fear of Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſuch
caſe belong to a Believer, or enter the Character of a true Fearer of
God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Anſ.)</hi> The Objection lies deep, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volveth in it, a
miſtake in the whole Tenour of the Covenant of Life, as it is the
Inſtrument of Gods Government over Mankind, one and other. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon
theſe following falſe ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Namely,</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:33235:26"/>
            <p n="1">1. That Faith alone enters the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the New
Covenant; the Covenant which God hath Enjoyned unto us, as the Apoſtle
Phraſeth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.20. contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, 2.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17, 18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.7, 8, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all ſuch Texts as thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, belong to
the Original Law of Works, or of Innocency, ſuch as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.
<hi>Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor Idolaters,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>ſhall inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> And if ſo, then no man dying
impenitently in thoſe ſins can be barred Eternal Life; for the Penalty of
the firſt Covenant is not concluſive, but of thoſe whom the New Covenant
doth not Relieve. And it alike commandeth ſpotleſs Innocency alſo, and
threats all ſin alike with damnation, as well as ſuch. Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That if ſuch Texts, with the threat contained in them,
do belong to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; yet as ſoon as any one believeth, he is
priviledged with a ſpecial exemption there-from. Tho he violate the precept,
the threat can take no place, not for any time to hold him under the
ſame.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:33235:26"/>
            <p>The Sum of the Hypotheſis, or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, which is by thoſe
who make the objection, defended; or muſt be, is, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
Goſpel Commands (or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels rather) obedience to the whole Law of God,
and Obedience thereunto is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by Precept unto every Soul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pain of ſin: But that it hath but one ſingle Precept, (which is that of
Faith) belonging to it, <hi>qua foedus,</hi> as a Covenant, or in Conjunction
with the promiſe; nor yet but one that belongs to it, <hi>qua lex,</hi> as a
Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with its Sanction or Threat. And then let a
Mans Faith work, or not work, to his eſcaping of all or any the ſins or
pollutions enumerated, ſtill it will ſave him. What ſhould bar his
acceptance with God, when the whole condition of the Covenant is performed, and
kept? What need of the fear mentioned, if all this be true? Or how can it
conſiſt?</p>
            <p>That it's more than poſſible for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to relapſe into
the ſins mentioned, which are threatned with death by the Goſpel, or Law of
Chriſt, is not, nor can be denied. Moſt dreadful inſtances we have upon
Record atteſting the ſame. <pb n="46" facs="tcp:33235:27"/>Neither let any one that
girdeth on his harneſs, yet boaſt himſelf as he that putteth it off? What
ſhall we now ſay in ſuch caſe? was there not cauſe to fear
deſtruction? To give but one inſtance. <hi>David</hi> upon an affront given
him by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> contrives to murder him, with all his Family, 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 25.22. was he now Pardoned, I ask, all that while that he was
upon his March, with his four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, to put the ſame in Execution?
Repent him for that time, he could not (nor can that be true without
reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is of its Eſſence) either now he had forfeited his
acceptance with God, and lay bound under the guilt of his ſin unpardoned, or
our Saviours Doctrine to his own Diſciples could not be words of truth, but a
meer ſcarecrow, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.15. <hi>But if ye forgive not men their
treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi>
So again expreſly, <hi>ch.</hi> 18.35. the forgiving of others is made the
indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable condition of our obtaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from God; yea, and a
recognition thereof enjoyned us, in our prayers to God for it, <hi>and forgive
us, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them,</hi> v. 12. and this <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33235:27"/>very well knew and feared it in caſes of that Nature,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 8. And if that be not pardon in
the moſt proper and ſtrict Senſe, it's not ſpoken of in all the
Scriptures; ſo 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>To that Text alledged, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. I anſwer, It's of
the final event, whereof it ſpeaks; it belongs to Gods Will of Purpoſe, or
his Decree, which ſpeaks not the Tenour of Gods Covenant with us. It's
ſpoken of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and of his Seed, <hi>v.</hi> 29. and
belongs to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Gods Decrees, (wherein the perſeverance of the
Elect is founded) not to his legal Conſtitution with man. There it runs, v.
30 <hi>if his Children forſake my Law, and walk not in my Judgments; if they
break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments.</hi> Here directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>If thy Children will keep my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and my Teſtimony,</hi> Pſal.
132.12. So it ran with <hi>David,</hi> and ſo it does with us,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11, 13. The meaning of the former
is no more, but that he will ſecure a ſeed unto Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
53.10. who they are, belongs to his ſecret purpoſe only to know, whilſt
they <pb n="48" facs="tcp:33235:28"/>are out of his way. But whoever they be, if they
belong to him, ſuch Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, or Promiſes do evermore include in them,
Gods Will or Purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them from their ſin, or ſore
relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (and that ſometimes by their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings too) in purſuance
of his decree, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. to the end that they may not periſh by his
Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32, 34. in the mean while, they are to fear,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. and to take heed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15, 17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1.5.9. yea the beſt of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>For destruction from God was a
terror to me,</hi> Job 31.23. that is, to awe him from ſin, <hi>v.</hi>
24.26, 28. ſo it was with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.120. ſo with St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. neither is it inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with
Faith. Nay it is the genuine product of it. <hi>By faith</hi> Noah <hi>being
warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark,
to the ſaving of his houſe, by the which he condemned the world, and became
heir of the righteouſneſs which is by faith,</hi> Heb. 11.7. Nor yet is it
inconſiſtent with a filial free obedience, to be governed by a Law, and to
be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the fear of it, whilſt there is a love to the duty
preſcribed by it, <pb n="49" facs="tcp:33235:28"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. nor yet with true
Goſpel Conſolation, and ſecurity, whilſt man keeps within the Bounds of
Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, not to violate the ſame, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.21. and to others
it belongs not. No man holds his Eſtate by a Title ſo Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feazible, but
that by the Guilt of any Capital Crime, it may be forfeited; yet an honeſt
Man may remain comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſecure for all that, in his poſſeſſion.
<hi>The law is not made for a righteous man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. he ſaith not for a <hi>Believer</hi> only, but for a
<hi>Godly man</hi> in his walk; <hi>againſt ſuch there is no law,</hi> Gal.
5.23. that is, it cannot hurt him; continuing ſuch, it hath nothing againſt
him. Yet will not God, for the ſake of any mans peace, reverſe his law (the
Law of Chriſt now I am ſpeaking of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.21.) nor yet
invalidate it, by ſevering the Precept from the Sanction or threat of it,
ſo to render his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meerly Precarious. Nor can any Believer make it
good, that the Law of Chriſt, abiding his Relation thereunto, is altered,
that it hath nothing to ſay to him if he break it. So much for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
inſtance of the fear due unto God, <pb n="50" facs="tcp:33235:29"/>which yet remains
unſhaken, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Character of a true fearer of him; namely the
Awe and Reverence of his Majeſty, and dread of Offending him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet further, the Fear of God here, Importeth an Habitual
Inclination of Heart and Soul unto a regard to God, with a due reſpect to all
his Commands. Hence the fear of God is oft put for his Service or Obedience.
<hi>If then I be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where is mine honour? and if I be a maſter, where
is my fear,</hi> ſaith the Lord of Hoſts? <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6 <hi>ye offer
the blind for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the lame and ſick, is it not evil? offer it now
unto thy governor, will he be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od with thee, or accept thy
perſon,</hi> ſaith the Lord? <hi>v.</hi> 8, 14. It's termed a fearing of
the Commandment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.13. <hi>That they may fear thee, to walk in
thy ways,</hi> 2 Chr. 6.31. It's all Grace and true Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in the
<hi>Root,</hi> Spring, and Principle of it. <hi>I will put my fear in their
hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32.40. to walk in the
fear of God, and in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is one and the ſame thing. Only that it
connoteth the inward reſpect that the Soul hath unto God in the keeping of
his commandments, (it's eye to him) <pb n="51" facs="tcp:33235:29"/>and deference of all to
his Glory; which is it that <hi>ſpecifieth</hi> every inſtance of
obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and renders it truly Religious. <hi>Then had the Churches reſt,
walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
Acts 9.31. the words of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks out the ſenſe of thoſe:
<hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me,</hi> Pſal. 16.8. this works
holineſs into the very frame of the Soul. Oh that we might never forget it!
<hi>but as of ſincerity, but as of God, in the ſight of God, ſpeak we in
Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. as in the ſight
of God. This is indeed to walk with God, which was the Encomium of
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> and of <hi>Noah;</hi> they walked with God in their Generation.
No man dare to call God to Record for a Witneſs, when he is about to commit
any notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſin. Let him but diſmiſs the thoughts of God, and ſhake
off his fear, and then he hath let himſelf looſe to all manner of
Abominations. And <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>becauſe I thought, ſurely
the fear of God is not in this place; and they will ſlay me,</hi> Gen. 20.11
he could have no ſecurity, whilſt the fear of God was not before their
eyes, nor God concerned in their actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, <pb n="52" facs="tcp:33235:30"/>as the Fear of God whereof I am now ſpeaking, doth ſeminally and
virtually contain in it all obedience to his will: ſo doth it run through
every line of it, and preſerve the Soul in it. A Prince that feareth God,
ruleth Juſtly, and that becauſe he feareth God. <hi>For the former
governors had been chargeable to the people; yea and their ſervants bear rule
over them; but ſo did not I, becauſe of the fear of God,</hi> Neh. 5.15.
ſuch a one is a Conſcientious, a Dutiful Subject, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5.
<hi>ſubject for conſcience ſake.</hi> Such a one is a Juſt and
Righteous Judg in his place. <hi>VVherefore now let the fear of the Lord be
upon you; with him there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, nor receiving of
reward,</hi> 2. Chr. 19.7. It maketh good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wives, <hi>Col.</hi>
3.18. <hi>as it is fit in the Lord. Husbands, v.</hi> 19. <hi>Children, v.</hi>
20. <hi>Fathers, v.</hi> 21. <hi>Servants, v.</hi> 22. <hi>Obeying in
ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, fearing God. Maſters, ch.</hi> 4.1. <hi>knowing
that ye alſo have a Maſter in Heaven.</hi> It influenceth the moſt
ſecret Actions, and runs through all. Obadiah <hi>feared the Lord
greatly,</hi> 1. Kings 18. and he hid the Prophets of the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 4.
<hi>I thy ſervant fear the Lord from my youth,</hi> 
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:33235:30"/>v.
12. There was a good beginning and example unto ſuch as are young,
<hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.1. <hi>The Midwives feared God, and did not as the King
of</hi> Egypt <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, but ſaved the Men-children alive,</hi>
Exod. 1.17. <hi>and therefore God made them houſes,</hi> v. 21. <hi>Such a
one fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Oath,</hi> Eccl. 9.2. or to do any injuſtice, 1
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. It's <hi>the fountain of life,</hi> Prov. 14.27. It
ſets all a work; and whilſt it keeps the Dominion, it keepeth the Soul
ſteddy to God, throughout the whole courſe of its life. It's not ſo much
one ſingle Grace, as it is the habit of all. Further inſtance of its
effectual Operation, in whoſoever it is, the next Branch of the Text, will
furniſh us with, which is the other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Perſon accepted with
God; of a Perſon, I ſay, <hi>accepted with him;</hi> not only of a working
ſaving Faith, as ſome would have it, which is to read the Scripture
backward; but immediately of a Perſon accepted to Life. For it hath the
Promiſe thereof connected with it, as well as Faith its ſelf, as the Text
witneſſeth. Nor indeed can any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a mans Juſtification, or
Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <pb n="54" facs="tcp:33235:31"/>be fetcht from that which hath no Promiſe of
it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>But in every nation, he that worketh
Righteouſneſs is accepted with God:</hi> That is the other Character to be
opened; what it is to be a worker of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Righteouſneſs is the Commenſuration or anſwering of what a
man doth, to the Rule or Standard of it, which is the Law of God; even as
ſin, to which it is oppoſed, is defined by its Tranſgreſſion of the
Law, as containing its whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal nature: Look then, as he that doth any
thing which in the matter or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof, the Law of God
forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, (and ſo for omiſſions), he doth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> make,
or work ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. The illegality of the action is its
obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and that can never be ſeparated from the entity of the action, or
the being of the ſame, ſo long as the Law doth abide that prohibiteth it:
ſo he that doth what is conformable to the ſame Law of God, he doth or
worketh Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous,
even as God is righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.7.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:33235:31"/>
            <p>For the more diſtinct underſtanding of what we are upon, it is
neceſſary in the firſt place, that we enquire into the Rule or Standard
of this Righteouſneſs, whereof the Text ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, <hi>ſtrictly</hi> ſuch, as it was
peculiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to be ſure is not it. The <hi>Gentile</hi>
Nations then knew it not; nor was <hi>Cornelius</hi> proſelited to it: Among
the <hi>Jews,</hi> whilſt ſome of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pretenders to it, and to
an abſolute conformity to it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. miſinterpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to a
ſubverſion of the ancient Faith of the Goſpel, and neglect of Chriſt,
they fell ſhort of ſo much as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience unto it, in its
ſpiritual interpretation, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed
the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall not enter into
the kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matt. 5.20. <hi>When the Gentiles attained unto it,
Rom</hi> 9.30.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let it be conſidered, that there hath been a twofold
Law, or Rule of Righteouſneſs enacted by God, and given to mankind; the one
to him whilſt <hi>innocent,</hi> the other to <hi>fallen</hi> man; the one
termed the law of Works, of perfect ſinleſs obedience; the other the 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33235:32"/>law of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. Tho neither did the
former exclude all <hi>Faith;</hi> nor yet the later all <hi>Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the former there is none righteous now, no not one,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10. Some are more atrocious ſinners than others; but none
that doth good, and ſinneth not, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.20. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.10.
No work done, meaſured by that Law or Rule, can be, or be termed to be a work
of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; this Law is ſtill in force, with its Threat,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. But no man by or according to it, can be accepted with God:
This the Apoſtle concludes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. The ſame did <hi>David</hi>
before him, <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight
ſhall no man living be juſtified,</hi> Pſal. 14.3.2. <hi>i. e.</hi> by
that Rule.</p>
            <p>To the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> to the remedying Law, which is the
ſtanding Law of Chriſt his <hi>mediatory</hi> Kingdom, conſtituted for
the relief of lapſed man, there are, and may be righteous perſons, <hi>i.
e.</hi> ſuch as are not wicked, as <hi>David</hi> interprets it,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.12, 13. but upright with God; and
ſuch were <hi>Zecharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth; Both righteous before God, 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33235:32"/>walking in all the commandments and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord
blameleſs,</hi> Luke 1.6. According to this Standard, through the Grace of
God there are works, and workers of Righteouſneſs to be found in the world,
tho but few comparatively, God knows. <hi>Cornelius</hi> to the beſt of his
light was ſuch a one; and accordingly he found acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>The univerſality, or unreſervedneſs of it, is the main
teſt of its ſincerity, which the Scriptures lay ſo much ſtreſs upon,
<hi>That ye may be ſincere, and without offence, till the day of
Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.10. <hi>For our rejoicing is this, the teſtimony of
our conſciences, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with
fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in
the world,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. I ſay, its trial lies in the
<hi>univerſality</hi> of obedience, which is indiſpenſably neceſſary
even unto life, that we be not put to ſhame, or confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Then ſhall
I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy commandments,</hi>
Pſal. 119.9. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a juſt or a

               </gap>,
<hi>if ye fulfil the royal law, ye do well,</hi> Jam. 2.8. That is, 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33235:33"/>the Goſpel Rule, the Law of Liberty, the Rule of Gods
Judgment, <hi>v.</hi> 12. if not, your Faith neither can't ſave you,

               </gap>, the perfect men, of whom the

<hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> whilſt they ſtood perfect and compleat in
the Will of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. Upright according to the interpretation of
the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. Reaching ſtill forward in the degree of
it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14.</p>
            <p>Now that we may not reſt altogether in Generals, and that yet we
may give ſome bounds to our diſcourſe upon this Head, it remaineth only
but to exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this working of Righteouſneſs by a collection of what
the particular Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof were in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whence the
Apoſtle took his meaſures that he was ſuch a one, and from whence he
draws his Inference in the words of the Text, <hi>Now I perceive,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>And they are reduced to theſe Four Heads, in the Story of him.
(1.) His Invocation of God. (2.) The Order of his Family, and his care of their
Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Eſtate. (3.) His Compaſſiion or <pb n="59" facs="tcp:33235:33"/>Charity.
(4.) His maintaining of a good report for Piety and Religion. Of all which
briefly in their order (not to ſpeak of bare negatives) here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For his Invocation of the Divine Being whom he feared, he
<hi>prayed to God alway,</hi> v. 2 4. So do all that fear God, and are accepted
with him. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be
ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.13. In what way he prayed, we have no account, whether by
a Form or without; Prayer its ſelf is a part or <hi>medium</hi> of Divine
Worſhip; whether after this or the other way, is but a mode or manner of
Worſhip, not limited by the Law of Nature or Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: Out of doubt,
praying by or with the help of a form, is lawful, yea and ſometimes may be a
duty, rather than to neglect Prayer, where abilities are wanting, <hi>Luk.</hi>
11.1. But for <hi>Cornelius,</hi> his appears rather to be <hi>ex pectore</hi>
out of his own Heart; he prayed with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and with underſtanding, as
it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. no doubt; but who of all the Nations ſhould
compoſe his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for him, I think no man can Divine. Prayer is a part of
natural Worſhip <pb n="60" facs="tcp:33235:34"/>and Religion; neither was there ever any
Nation ſo Barbarous, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged any God at all, that doubted of their
Obligation to invocate his Name; whatever their ignorance have been of the true
God; ſo were the <hi>Ninivites</hi> conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nced, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.9. ſo the Mariners in
the Storm, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.5. <hi>And they cried every man to his God.</hi>
And, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was a wickedneſs in <hi>Darius</hi> and his Nobles, to
Eſtabliſh a Law but for thirty days to reſtrain it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.7.
which therefore alſo <hi>Daniel</hi> contemned, <hi>v.</hi> 10. It's a duty
moſt expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4 6. and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part
of our acknowledgment of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> prayed with his Family, out of queſtion. God
will be worſhipped in Societies, this the Light of Nature doth Dictate; and
Families were the firſt Churches, and Original of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. Shall men
aſſociate for other ends, and not for the Worſhip of God? <hi>Then began
men to call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 4.26. <hi>i. e.</hi> in
Societies: the fear of God is not in thoſe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies where it is otherwiſe;
but it was in his.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:33235:34"/>
            <p>But it ſeems to be private Cloſet pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that is here noted
of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the ſame which our Saviour recommends, <hi>Mat.</hi>
6.5. where more frequency and liberty may be uſed, wherein he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was
ſo frequent, <hi>Matt.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.35. and ſo were all the
moſt Eminent Saints in the Scriptures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. <hi>Pſalm</hi>
55.17. and 119. <hi>I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the dawning of the morning, and
cried,</hi> v. 147, 148. <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. ſo here
in the Context, <hi>Peter went up to pray,</hi> v. 9. The praying Perſon is
the thriving Chriſtian, and enjoys moſt of God.</p>
            <p>Two Circumſtances of <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Prayer, we have here
noted. (1.) The Solemnity. (2.) The Aſſiduity or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Solemnity. It was joyned with faſting, he was
faſting until this hour; <hi>and at the ninth hour;</hi> that was, about
three of the Clock in the Afternoon, <hi>the Angel of God appeared unto
him,</hi> v. 30. Faſting on extraordinary occaſion, is a Goſpel Duty,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 9.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. and it ſpeaks the importunity of
his Prayers. <hi>The</hi> energetical <hi>fervent prayer of <pb n="62" facs="tcp:33235:35"/>a righteous man availeth much,</hi> Jam. 5.16. <hi>fervent in
ſpirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Aſſiduity of it. <hi>He prayed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> v. 2.
ſometime in a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, as before; but he never left off
the Duty. <hi>Praying always, with all prayer and ſupplication in the
ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> Epheſ. 6.18.
that is, be alway ready for it, never neglecting it, in its due Seaſon.
<hi>Men ought always to pray, and not to faint,</hi> Luke 18.1. When men go on
meerly in a formal way, keeping their rounds in the Duties of Religion as the
door turneth on its hinges, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Life or Progreſs; they are apt to
knock off, or grow weary. <hi>Ye ſaid alſo, behold what a weartneſs it
is?</hi> Mal. 1.13. <hi>What is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve him, and
what profit ſhould we have, if we pray unto him?</hi> Job 21.15. This is to
ſpeak it out, they could gain nothing by driving the Trade, and no wonder if
they ſlight it, or totally give it over.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Cornelius</hi> feared God, and his Soul followed hard
aſter him, and kept his <pb n="63" facs="tcp:33235:35"/>way; and what profit he found
therein we have this account of it, v. 4. And he ſaid unto him, <hi>Thy
prayers are come up into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance before God</hi> i. e. as the Sacrifice
and Incenſe offered: <hi>Let my Prayers be ſet forth before thee as
incenſe; and the lifting up of my hands, as the evening ſacrifice,</hi>
Pſal. 141.2. God will not forget them; <hi>and a Book of remembrance was
written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his
Name,</hi> Mal. 3.16. <hi>And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of Host,
in the day when I make up my Jewels,</hi> v. 17. which is in anſwer to what
the wicked had ſaid, v. 14. <hi>It is in vain to ſerve God, and what profit
is it that we have kept his Ordinance?</hi> This was the Character of
<hi>Cornelius</hi> unto <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> the ſame with that of <hi>Saul,</hi>
recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him to <hi>Ananias; behold he prayeth,</hi> Acts 9.11. and how
ſignally did God ſhew his Acceptance of them both!</p>
            <p n="2">2. The order of his Family, and his care of their
Soul-concernments, was another inſtance of his working righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.
<hi>He feared God with all his houſhold,</hi> v. 2. ſuch he endeavoured to 
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33235:36"/>get into his Family, or to make them ſuch. <hi>He called
two of his ſervants, and a ſoldier that feared God, one of them that waited
on him,</hi> v. 7. What a ſtrait had he been now put to, had he had none
about him that ſavoured the things of God, to declare his mind to, or to
ſend on ſuch a meſſage? he would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been expoſed to
ſcorn. <hi>He that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerve me,</hi>
ſaith <hi>David; he that worketh deceit, ſhall not dwell within my
houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 101.6, 7. <hi>Lord, who ſhall abide in thy
Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> Pſal. 15. <hi>He in whoſe Eyes a vile Perſon is
contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord,</hi> v. 4.
<hi>Cornelius</hi> lookt not only to have his Family obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious to
himſelf, but he would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the contempt of God in it; he taught them
the fear of the Lord. How had he invited and gotten together his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and
Friends alſo, to hear the word from <hi>Peter;</hi> words, whereby he would
have them ſaved as well as his own Houſhold, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 33. the
neglect of Family Care and Inſtruction, or inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for it, is the bane of
the Church, and holy Commonwealth. <hi>For I know</hi> 
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:33235:36"/>Abraham, ſaith God, <hi>that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Children and his
Houſhould after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord,</hi> Gen.
18.19. Yea, how often hath a pious Family Inſtruction and Nurture, been
bleſſed of God, being accompanied with a good Exemplary walk, unto the
ingenerating the fear of God, or the Seed thereof, in the tender Branches of
the ſame; and the neglect thereof, is Cruelty to them. <hi>I was my Fathers
Son,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, tender and only beloved in the ſight of my
Mother. He taught me alſo, and ſaid unto me; let thine heart retain my
words: keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and live,</hi> Prov. 4.3, 4. thoſe were the
commandments of God, that have the Promiſe of Life; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. ſo
did <hi>David</hi> Catechiſe him. <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> was taught the Principles
of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>from a Child, and knew the Holy Scriptures</hi> by the
Education of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14, 15. whoſe pedigree the
Apoſtle derives from worthy Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, tho by the Mothers ſide. <hi>When
I call to remembrance the unfeigned Faith that is in thee, which dwelt firſt
in thy Grandmother Lois, and thy Mother Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> 
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:33235:37"/>ch.
1.5. <hi>And I am perſwaded in thee alſo. Train up a child in the way he
ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it,</hi> Prov. 22.6.
Ordinarily (tho not always) a Bleſſing may be expected; the Duty is
unqueſtionable; and ſo for Servants alſo, the ſame care is to be had,
tho of Children more eſpecially, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. How elſe can a pious
Family, ſuch as <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s, be expected?</p>
            <p n="3">3. His Alms are noted, as another inſtance of his Piety,
or a fruit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. <hi>Who gave much Alms to the People,</hi> v.
2. The word in the <hi>Greek</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, Mercy or Compaſſion, which
is more intimate to the Soul, and is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to the exterior Act, or
relief gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Indigent. Without the later, there can be no pretence to
the former. <hi>If a Brother or Siſter,</hi> that is, one of the Chriſtian
Religion, (for ſo it's to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as the term of a Believer oft is,
and Saint, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>ch.</hi> 7.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.) <hi>be naked, and deſtitute of daily food, and one of
you ſay unto him, depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithſtanding
you give them not thoſe things which are needful to the <pb n="67" facs="tcp:33235:37"/>Body; what doth it profit?</hi> Jam. 2.15. ſo neither is this any
thing, without the inward Affection, and Eye to God alſo in it; it belongs
not to Religion. Remarkable is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.
<hi>Tho I beſtow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and give my Body to be
burned, and have no Charity, it profiteth me nothing,</hi> v. 3. It's a
ſeeming Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox; what, give all to the Poor, and have no Charity? Yes, it
may ſo be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.1. This Duty of Bowels of Mercy, and
ſeaſonable help to ſuch as are the proper Objects of it, the Goſpel
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth, and highly recommendeth it <hi>Luke</hi> 11.41. It is their right,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16.12. It's of the weighty things of the Law: Mercy is one,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing inſtant in prayer,</hi> Rom. 12.12. to
which is ſubjoined, <hi>Diſtributing to the neceſſity of Saints, given
to Hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> v. 13. theſe went together in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius.</hi>
And this later is ſo much the more a Duty, as it may be of uſe to make way
for the weightier exerciſe of Compaſſion and Charity toward the Souls of
them we have to do with, as it is diſpoſitive to Inſtruction; all
kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <pb n="68" facs="tcp:33235:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>is ſo. Hence, it is in a ſpecial
manner required in thoſe of the Miniſtry, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.8. It's an
eſſential part of Religion; <hi>Pure Religion, and undefiled before God and
the Father, is this, to viſit the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and Widows in their
Affliction, and to keep himſelf unſpoted from the World:</hi> this is more
than tything of Mint and Aniſe. <hi>Thine Alms are come up for a memorial
before God,</hi> v. 4, 31. <hi>For with ſuch Sacrifices the Lord is well
pleaſed,</hi> Heb. 13.16. <hi>As it is written, he hath given to the Poor,
his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs remaineth for ever,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. It's a
high Expreſſion, but not the leaſt Derogatory to the Grace of God; it
means no more, <hi>than that God will not forget to reward it,</hi> Heb. 6.10.
<hi>For</hi> I <hi>was an hungry, and ye gave me meat: I was thirſty, and ye
gave me Drink: Naked, and ye clothed me,</hi> Mat. 25 35. <hi>For,</hi> is a
rational particle, and aſſigned for the reaſon, tho not the proper
effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or meritorious cauſe of acceptance. <hi>That they be rich in good
works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate, laying up in ſtore for
themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33235:38"/>lay hold of eternal Life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.18, 19. not ſo as
Chriſt is the Foundation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. but in Chriſt it hath the
Promiſe to it, and Gods word is to be truſted to; it's atteſted by his
Apoſtles, and all the Prophets, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. See <hi>Matt.</hi>
7.24.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He maintained a good report for Piety and Religion, which
is the laſt Fruit of Righteouſneſs inſtanced in. <hi>And of good report
among all the Nations of the</hi> Jews, v. 22. They would ſcarce think that
he could be ſaved; but for all that, they thought that if any one, a
<hi>Gentile,</hi> could, he might; he was true to his light, and walked moſt
convincingly; they could ſay no other of him; the ſame was the Character of
<hi>Ananias, Acts</hi> 22.12. And a weighty one it is, that wherein the Teſt
of a pious Man doth much lie, that is one Qualification of a Perſon called to
the Miniſtry, That he muſt have a good Report of them which are without, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. His uſefulneſs otherwiſe in the Church of God, muſt
needs be impaired; and ſo will any man elſe in his place. Yea, and tho to
be a man-pleaſer, to get every <pb n="70" facs="tcp:33235:39"/>ones good word, may be an
evil, and is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. And moreover, no mans name, be he never ſo
exact, is in his own keeping; <hi>through evil report, and good report,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8. and our Lord himſelf found it
ſo: Yet I ſay, a good man ought to look after it, and to value a good
report for Piety and Godlineſs. <hi>Demetrius</hi> hath a good report of all
men, and of the Truth its ſelf, 3 <hi>John</hi> 12. ſo ought we to
endeavour it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. The tryal of Sincerity lieth not only in a
regard to things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly commanded, or forbidden; but in a regard to the
Glory of God, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not ſo particularly or expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in
the letter of the Law, as being but of ill report, or carrying but an
appearance of evil, which comes within the Conſtruction of the Law.
<hi>Abſtain from all appearance of evil,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.22. A bare
appearance of Good, is of no worth in the ſight of God; but to avoid the
appearance of Evil, is: <hi>Finally, brethren, whatſoever things are True,
Honeſt, Just, Pure, Lovely, whatſover things are of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; if there
be any Vertue, and if there <pb n="71" facs="tcp:33235:39"/>be any praiſe, think on
theſe things,</hi> Phil. 4.8. It's an ill ſign for a man to take the
ſtretch of his Liberty, and ſtrain the Law it may be too. A pious Soul that
fears God, will have a care, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence exerciſed, to keep him back
from any thing that may border upon evil. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.15. or that any
ways (tho without juſt cauſe) might likely give occaſion to others to
reflect a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto God, or cauſe the name of Religion to ſuffer.
He is tender of Gods Name, and the Reputation of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which he
Profeſſes, tho with an Abridgment of his own Liberty other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or
receding from his right. Such a one was <hi>Cornelius,</hi> or he had not kept
up his good report among a people ſo ſelf-confident and ſcornful of all
other people of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as common and prophane. Thus have we
finiſhed the ſecond character of a perſon accepted with God, and the
indication or mark of a true fearer of him; which may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the
doctrinal part. It remaineth only to bring the ſame more home, in its
Application, or Uſe.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:33235:40"/>
            <p>The Uſe we ſhall handle, (1.) by way of Information or
Inſtruction. (2.) Of Reproof or Conviction. (3.) Of Conſolution and
Eſtabliſhment. (4.) Of Exhortation and Direction, purſuant to the
Doctrine inſiſted upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of Information or Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Is it ſo, that
of a truth God is no reſpecter of perſons, or of what Nation they be, in
the point of acceptance with him, otherwiſe than as they be found fearers of
him, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Then, how vain will the pretentions of multitudes, even
with us, one day be found, who hope to put in their claim unto the Favour and
Mercy of God, on no better foundation or plea, than that they are a Chriſtian
people, or of a Nation or Body of that belief and profeſſion? Could not
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion ſtem the currant of the Grace of God, to anticipate his
accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of true piety in whomſoever it might be found? Neither would
Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion avail any thing unto his favour, where the ſame piety and
fear of him was wanting. This the Text concludes, and is directly within its
ſcope. In every Nation, ſuch as ſear not God, neither <pb n="73" facs="tcp:33235:40"/>work Righteouſneſs, ſhall not be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him. And what
was true of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is as true with us: and what their pretenſions
were, are obvious; and thine, no queſtion, may equal them, and more, if thou
beeſt a Chriſtian. Let us weigh the parallel, and give thee thy advantage,
and try what it will amount unto in the caſe, without the fear of God.</p>
            <p>They were a <hi>Covenant</hi>-people, the whole bulk of them, good

<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.19. Not putative, or <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum apparentiam</hi> only,
in viſibility, or appearance only. The notion of a <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Church, or people of God, as now ſenſed, was not then known in the World.
<hi>Coram Deo,</hi> In the ſight and judgment of God, they ſtood ſo
related unto him in reality, who yet were no true fearers of him, many of them,
yea the greater part. Well then, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is now taken from them,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 21.43. and amongſt others its given to this Nation, an Iſle
of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Iſa.</hi> 42.4. and thou haſt thy ſhare in it. 
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33235:41"/>
               <hi>Behold therefore the ſeverity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Gud:
on them ſeverity which fell; but towards thee goodneſs, if thou continue in
his goodneſs: otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off, Rom.</hi> 11.22.
Thou art grafted into, and partakeſt of the root and fatneſs of the
<hi>Olive-tree,</hi> the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the room of the
branches broken off, who alſo were once really in, but ſtumbled at
Chriſt, and fell, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the
wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God!</hi> v. 33. With what a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did
<hi>Paul</hi> reſent the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> loſs of their antecedent
relation to God! <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. the which, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God,
thou yet retaineſt: But all this availed not unto life or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; nor
will thee. Yet further, They were <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>nature,</hi> in the
force of God's Covenant, and not ſinners of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Gal. 2.15.
<hi>i e. Natural</hi> branches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.21. born ſuch, and their
ſeed Gods, (tho of wicked Parents, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8, 21.) And thou art a
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian born <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16, 17. and thy Children holy, not common, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. I will not deny thee any advantage <pb n="75" facs="tcp:33235:41"/>that
God will account with thee for. But God is no reſpecter of perſons meerly
on that ſcore, to accept thee. <hi>Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anguiſh upon every
ſoul of man that doth evil, of the</hi> Chriſtian firſt, and alſo of
the <hi>Jew, Mahometan,</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Infidel World, <hi>Rom.</hi>
2.9. <hi>For there is no reſpect of perſons with God,</hi> v. 11.</p>
            <p>Again, They were nigh to God, and had more hope and helps for
Eternal Life, than others that were ſtrangers to the covenant of advantages
peculiar to them, had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. they had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of Gods
Oracles, which was more than to be within the ſound of them, <hi>v.</hi> 2.
And this is now thy priviledge with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and all the World comparatively
are in a hopeleſs condition beſides, if not abſolutely loſt. But God
reſpects thee not for this; thou maiſt periſh by thy own neglect for all
that, without eſcape, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. as well as they.</p>
            <p>Again, They were Circumciſed, and took upon them to be debtors
to the whole Law: And thou art Baptized, and become a debtor to the whole
Goſpel, and haſt the badge of Gods Covenant upon thee as they had,
<hi>Acts</hi> 7.8. But, <pb n="76" facs="tcp:33235:42"/>as <hi>Circumciſion</hi> profited
not, unleſs they kept the Law; but was made uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, <hi>Rom.</hi>
2.25. ſo, neither can Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm now ſave <hi>without</hi> the anſwer of
a good Conſcience towards God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. it ſhall no more be
accounted to thee, than if thou were unbaptized.</p>
            <p>They had the Law and the Service of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>The
Temple of the Lord are theſe, Jer.</hi> 4 7. ſo do the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and
Service of the Goſpel belong to, and oblige thee; thou art of the Church, and
all the inſtitutions of the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it. If thou beeſt
ſecluded, it's for thy own prophaneſs or contempt; and thou art not thereby
neither broken off the <hi>Olive-tree,</hi> I grant, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.15.
but however, this is not to be truſted to: God reſpects no mans perſon
for that. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> partook of Sacraments with Gods Warrant,
<hi>with whom,</hi> many of them, <hi>God was not well pleaſed,</hi> 1 Cor.
10.4, 5. Thou maiſt have eaten and drunk in Chriſt's preſence, and yet he
not own thee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.26.</p>
            <p>To come yet nearer; In the point of Belief: Thou believeſt that
there is one God; ſo did they, when they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <pb n="77" facs="tcp:33235:42"/>the golden Calf which they had made, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.5. and ſo do
<hi>the Devils alſo believe and tremble,</hi> Jam. 2.19.</p>
            <p>Again, The <hi>Jews</hi> did believe the Scriptures of the <hi>Old
Teſtament</hi> to be the word of God, a divine Record in the whole; ſome
underſtanding leſs, ſome more of it, they admitted it for the Standard of
Doctrines, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.28. <hi>ch.</hi> 26.27. <hi>We are</hi> Moſes
<hi>Diſciples,</hi> ſay they. <hi>We know that God ſpake unto him,</hi>
Joh. 9.29. in him they truſted: <hi>For in them ye think ye have eternal
Life,</hi> Chap. 5.39. ſo thou believeſt of both Teſtaments; thou
owneſt the Revelation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; but what is this to acceptance with
God? <hi>Who have received the Law by the diſpoſition of Angels, and have
not kept it,</hi> Acts 7.53. Out of thy own, mouth, upon the Goſpel will God
take iſſue in his final Judgment againſt thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 11. The Bible which thou carrieſt to the Church with thee,
if thou feareſt not God, even it ſhall condemn thee, as now it judgeth
thee. Yet farther,</p>
            <p>They alſo <hi>call themſelves the holy City, and ſtay
themſelves upon the God of Iſrael,</hi> 
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:33235:43"/>Iſal. 48.2.
<hi>They leaned upon the Lord, and ſaid, Is not the Lord among us?</hi> Mic.
3.11. this was their National claim, but what was all that, whilſt <hi>they
built up Zion with blood, and Jeruſalem with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> v. 10. In the
general alſo, they looked for the <hi>Meſſias; Unto which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe our
twelve Tribes inſtantly ſerving God day and night, hope to come,</hi> Acts
26.7. Tho their apprehenſions of him were indeed very confuſed; and now
being come, to the moſt of them he was a Stone of ſtumbling, <hi>Acts</hi>
4.11. In like manner thou leaneſt on God, and thou calleſt thy ſelf a
Chriſtian, (ſome ſcarce knowing at all what Chriſt was; others more
diſtinctly underſtanding (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Truth of him) thou art a
Diſciple of his, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26. <hi>Cha.</hi> 11.26. a Believer; not
almoſt, but altogether a Chriſtian in Belief and Religion, tho not ſuch a
one as <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.28. But a Believer thou art; not
<hi>ore tenus,</hi> or nominally only; but really in its kind; the ſtile may
truely belong to thee, as heretofore it did to all that were of the Chriſtian
belief, and is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently denominated of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33235:43"/>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Who
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not to the ſaving of their Souls,</hi> Heb. 10.39. nor were
influenced any more by it, than others by their belief of the Deity,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. of which no queſtion could be made, nor doubt, were not
men deficient to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then this to be thy plea, for reſpect unto thy
perſon with God; that thou art no <hi>Jew,</hi> nor <hi>Gentile,</hi> but of
the Church of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. built on <hi>Peters</hi>
Confeſſion, that <hi>Jeſus is the Chriſt, the ſon of the living
God,</hi> Matt. 16.18. This thou believeſt, that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name
under Heaven given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou muſt be ſaved; but ſo did the Devils
believe of him moſt expreſly, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.41. ſo
the Damſel cried concerning <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Theſe men are the
ſervants of the moſt high God, which ſhew unto us the way of
ſalvation,</hi> Acts 16.17. (whilſt the Anticipation of Education, Laws and
Cuſtoms, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with a great part of mankind to disbelieve and reject the
ſame, and do to this day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 25.19. (which
is not thy caſe.) Thy Faith is ſound and Orthodox ſo far forth.
More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <pb n="80" facs="tcp:33235:44"/>poſſibly thou art ſo far true to thy
Conviction herein, that thou renounceſt thy own Righteouſneſs which is of
the Law, and all other Pleas, and betakeſt thy ſelf (in thy way) wholly to
Chriſt for Salvation. So do all with us generally recognize in the preamble
of their laſt Will and Teſtament; and do mean, no queſtion, as they
ſay. Fleſh and Blood hath nothing in a bred Chriſtian againſt it, that
is, no Heretick; whilſt Chriſt is looked unto as a Saviour only. Thou
thinkeſt it may be, that the fear of God, and working Righteouſneſs,
enter not the terms of acceptance with him, nor is ſuppoſed to a regular
belief on, or particular truſt to, or hope in Chriſt for thy Salvation: Or
that thou art a fearer of God, when there is no ſuch thing, and hereupon thou
believeſt in his Name, as they did, <hi>John</hi> 2.23, 24. and the Rulers,
Chap. 12. Who <hi>believed on him,</hi> v. 42. <hi>but did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
him;</hi> loving the praiſe of men, more than of God, and there ſplit
themſelves; rendring that their Faith a meer Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, being deficient
in that which was to come between their aſſent, and <pb n="81" facs="tcp:33235:44"/>ſuch reliance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. ſo did <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the
Magician, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13, 23. ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. <hi>John</hi> 8.30,
31. or it may be thou renounceſt the Plea of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,</hi> as
Heretical, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. neither indeed canſt thou ſay, that thou
art no Extortioner, Unjuſt, Adulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which yet may be
true, that thou art not, and thou not a righteous Perſon for all that,
<hi>v.</hi> 9.) but wallowing in ſuch Sins, thou art yet reſolved to betake
thee to the Plea of the <hi>Publican: God be merciful to me a ſinner,</hi> v.
13. and hopeſt to have the priviledg on this plea of thy Sin, and Mercy too.
If thou beeſt otherwiſe convinced, thou mayeſt be nearer to acceptance,
or the way unto it, than he that thinks himſelf whole, and is not,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12. But tho Chriſt be added to thy Plea of Mercy, or the
belief of him, and thou makeſt thy boaſt of him, and intendeſt to abide
by thy plea to the laſt: <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy
Name,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 7.22. Thou ſhalt have the Priviledg of thy Nation,
and outward Relation to him, granted thee; but thou mayeſt read thy Doom for
all that, if no doer <pb n="82" facs="tcp:33235:45"/>of his Will, <hi>v.</hi> 26.
<hi>Depart from me ye that work iniquity,</hi> v. 23. Thou buildeſt not
aright on the foundation; and tho thou, like <hi>Joab,</hi> art fled unto the
horns of the Altar, there ſhalt thou periſh. <hi>The Lord of that
Servant</hi> (there is thy Badge and Title) <hi>ſhall come in a day when he
looked not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and ſhall cut him
aſunder,</hi> Mat. 24.50. <hi>and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him his portion with the</hi>
Infidels, Luke 12.46. If Chriſt be not in thee, the hope of Glory,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. <hi>God is no reſpector of Perſons; but the Children of
his Kingdom, even they ſhall be caſt out into outer darkneſs; there
ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi> Mat. 8.12. No one of any
Nation or Religion, that feareth not God, or that worketh not
Righteouſneſs, ſhall be accepted with him. What the Apoſtle ſaid of
the Law and Circumciſion, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.25, 27. or of the <hi>Jew, v.</hi>
28, 29. <hi>Mutatis mutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> is as true of the Chriſtian, of
Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Goſpel, now in its laſt Edition, to which my Text
agreeth, and which is alſo the Argument of the Apoſtle <hi>James,
Chap.</hi> 2. from <hi>v.</hi> 14. <pb n="83" facs="tcp:33235:45"/>to the end of the
Chapter, reſpecting Faith alone, without the works of Righteouſneſs,
whereof we have been treating, when he ſaith, <hi>That it profits
not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of Reproof, Tryal and Conviction. Is this the
diſcriminating Character between the Chriſtian out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward, (as
before of the <hi>Jew</hi>) and the only ſure Teſt of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
acceptance with God, to be a fearer of him, and a worker of Righteouſneſs.
What a multitude then are there, who upon this Iſſue do ſtand convict and
judged by the Goſpel, for Perſons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed and rejected of God, who
can put in no claim to acceptance with him; whilſt yet, almoſt all men
amongſt us, do verily hope to be ſaved at laſt: Gods favour they will not
deſpair of.</p>
            <p>To be miſtaken in this great point, is very common and eaſie,
as it is alſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. What elſe meaneth thoſe ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Cautions
in Scripture given unto men, to take heed that they deceive not themſelves in
the caſe? <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kindom
of God? be not deceived,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. Who <pb n="84" facs="tcp:33235:46"/>they are, he
ſubjoyns, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked,</hi>
Gal. 6.7. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words,</hi> Eph. 5.6. The
unrighteous, and ſuch as fear not God, can have no part nor portion in his
favour or acceptance. Let us then in his fear, ſearch this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the
bottom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God can't be Juſt nor True, if it ſhould be otherwiſe; all
our Religion muſt be a Cheat, and the Scriptures a Fable, if this Doctrine be
not true: But if it be true, as it is,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) What will become of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thoſe who very
ſeldom, if ever, do all the Day or Week long, ſo much as think on God or
his Name; ſuch can have no pretence to the walking in his fear. How can that
man ſet God alway before him, or be influenced by the fear of him, who has
committed the thoughts of him to Oblivion? <hi>God is not in all his
thoughts,</hi> Pſalm 10.4. a ſad and black Character. <hi>So are the paths
of all that forget God, and the hypocrites hope ſhall periſh,</hi> Job
8.13. <hi>Shall not God ſearch this out?</hi> Pſa. 44.20, 21. What no room
for ſo much as a thought of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It's not difficult to find whence it
is, or <pb n="85" facs="tcp:33235:46"/>what, that lies at the bottom. <hi>Can a Maid forget
her Ornaments, or a Bride her Attire? Yet my People</hi> (the <hi>Jews</hi>)
<hi>have forgotten me days without number,</hi> Jer. 2.32. Why can't the Maid
forget her Ornaments if ſhe would? Scarce; or the Bride her Attire? Why,
thoſe things have gotten the Heart and Affections, are eſteemed of as a
Treaſure, and ſo carries the Heart after, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.21. and the
Thoughts, which are as the Pulſes of the Heart, work accordingly: but they
had no eſteem or love for God in their heart, and ſo forgot him. How many
is this the caſe of with us? That mind their buſineſs, it may be, but
mind not God at all: As to ſuch, God is as if he were not; fear him they
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or concern him in what they do, who think not of him, and deſperate
is their Condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. far from acceptance with God.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Set aſide ſuch as would indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly
extingniſh out of their mind and conſcience the light and ſenſe of the
Being of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe may be afraid of him, but can have no pretence to
the fear of God, of which we have been <pb n="86" facs="tcp:33235:47"/>treating. <hi>And
even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledg, God gave them over
to a reprobate mind,</hi> Rom. 1.28. Know God they did, but they liked it not;
whether they liked it or not, it broke in upon them the Conviction thereof; but
fain they would ſhake it off, ſo as not to retain it: They <hi>liked not,
at leaſt, to retain it. Therefore they ſay unto God, depart from us, for we
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not the knowledg of thy ways,</hi> Job 21.14. they would get looſe
from him. <hi>What is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi> v. 15.
Theſe are far from being true fearers of him, or accepted of him.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Set aſide all thoſe, who if they retain the Senſe
of the Deity, yet frame in their mind a falſe Notion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of his
Being; make him an Idol, or what he is not. <hi>They ſlay the widow, and
murder the fatherleſs: yet they ſay, the Lord ſhall not ſee, neither
ſhall the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>regard it,</hi> Pſal. 94.6, 7. <hi>Thou
thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as they ſelf,</hi> Pſal.
50.21. that is, that God minded not what they did, or kept no Record of their
Actions: <hi>But I <pb n="87" facs="tcp:33235:47"/>will reprove thee, and ſet them in
order before thine eyes: Now conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt I tear
you in pieces, and there be none to deliver,</hi> v. 22. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taketh God
for all Mercy, and no Juſtice, or make a blind or a falſe God of him, that
will not make good his Word, how can ſuch poſſibly truely fear him, or
conſequently be accepted with him?</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Set aſide all the workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, who harden
themſelves openly againſt God, ſuch can't pretend to the fear of him.
Remarkable is that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſalm 36.1. <hi>The
tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, that there is no
fear of God before his Eyes.</hi> It ſpake out the thing to the quick
ſenſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> heart, that it muſt be impoſſible for
ſuch to have the fear of God before their Eyes. What, for men not to fear an
Oath, to commit Whoredom, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, Injuſtice, and all Filthineſs,
and yet to fear God in the mean while! It's a Contradiction. <hi>Who drinketh
ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity like water,</hi> Job 15.16. <hi>He ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out his hand
againſt God, and ſtrengh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <pb n="88" facs="tcp:33235:48"/>himſelf againſt the
Almighty,</hi> v. 25. <hi>He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick
boſſes of his Bucklers,</hi> v. 26. that is, he boldly, and without all
fear, hardneth himſelf againſt God, and ruſheth upon him, and the
Violation of his Law, when he comes forth againſt him, armed as it were for
his Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Such there are in the World, and whoſoever they be,
whoſe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do ſhew them to be of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we may without any
breach of Charity conclude them not to be fearers of God. Shall the man,
<hi>who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things, are
worthy of Death,</hi> Rom. 1.29, 31. go for one that has any fear of God,
whilſt he not only does the ſame, but hath pleaſure in them that do them?
<hi>v.</hi> 32. And don't we ſee or hear of ſuch, who will acknowledg
Drunkenneſs to be threatned with Death, and yet will not only do the ſame,
but rejoyce to drink down a Perſon, or take pleaſure in it, and ſo in
other Sins; which is to bid a defiance to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Will God accept ſuch
a Perſon? No, he may <hi>bleſs himſelf in his heart, <pb n="89" facs="tcp:33235:48"/>ſaying, I ſhall have peace, tho I walk in the imagination of mine
heart, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt,</hi> Deut. 29.19. (and the caſe is
the ſame as to other Sins) <hi>But the Lord will not ſpare him, but the
anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man,</hi>
v. 20. It's a certain Indication of a reprobate ſtate.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Yet farther, What ſhall we think of thoſe, who are
Scorners and Contemners of thoſe who fear God, to whom a vile Perſon is not
ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as one that makes conſcience of his ways. Surely ſuch
are far from the fear of God themſelves; yet this hath been, and ſtill is
the caſe of many. <hi>Wherein they think it ſtrange that you run not with
them to the ſame exceſs of riot, ſpeaking evil of you,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.4.
<hi>Who ſhall give account to him that is ready to judg the quick and the
dead,</hi> v. 5. they wonder that any ſhould be ſo tender, whilſt their
own Conſciences are <hi>caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized or ſeared as with a hot Iron,</hi> that
they don't bleed any longer, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. yea, and have them in
deriſion, <hi>Job</hi> 12 4. A Perſon that truely fears God, will like the
Principle in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <pb n="90" facs="tcp:33235:49"/>he may hope it to be; however
poſſibly he may take another to be miſguided or miſtaken, in the
conduct of his Conſcience toward God, he would not have him caſt off the
fear of God for all that, or be too bold with his Conſcience, whilſt it
ſpeaks in Gods Name, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.20, 28, 29. It's
a reproach with us, not to be called a fearer of God; but I wiſh that with
many it were not a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to be one truely fearing him. To ridicule
Purity, Preciſeneſs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or the Fear of God, under the Pretext,
that it's the Perſon only that is ſtruck at, who pretends to it, and and
has it not; is a practice introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to Atheiſm and Irreligion; and for
the moſt part is but a pretence neither; it's the Life, Power and Practice of
true Religion that is indeed expoſed, whilſt men are aſhamed openly to
relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the empty Name of it themſelves; and where it is ſo, it's a
certain Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch a Perſon, not to have any ſenſe of God, or
of his fear, on his Soul, nor conſequently any Intereſt in, or claim to his
Favour, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:33235:49"/>
            <p n="6">(6.) All the former being ſet aſide, as openly judged of
God, ſo as to have no pretence left for their coming within the Character of
the Text. Let us now more intimately reflect back upon the Explication of the
meaning and import of the fear of God and working Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by a
Recapitulation of the heads before inſiſted on, for the opening of their
eſſential Nature, and ſee then how many more will be found ſhort of
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, who may have ſome kind of pretence unto it, as taking
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves qualified for it. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was a godly Man, that was
his Character, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the Text. But now there is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the meer form, Cask, Garb, or ſhew of Godlineſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. as
well as the Life and Power of it; or, which may be without it, thou
pretendeſt to the fear of God, as ever thou lookeſt for acceptance with
him; but canſt thou make good thy plea? Thou haſt it in thy Creed, but
haſt thou it in thy Heart?</p>
            <p>Particularly for Inſtance, Art thou a Worſhipper of the true
God, and that in Spirit and in Truth? What revenue <pb n="92" facs="tcp:33235:50"/>of
Glory, what homage doſt thou pay to him? Or on what foundation doſt thou
go? Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Is
it a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service that thou payeſt unto the Divine Being? Haſt
thou ever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the entrance of Sin into the World, had laid
Mankind under the Curſe of God, ſo as that no Worſhip or Service of his
could find acceptance with him? How comeſt thou then by the perſwaſion,
that God will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept an Offering at thy hands? Or, haſt thou
conſidered theſe things? Or, how ſtandeth thy heart affected with the
good Pleaſure of God, in the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of forgiveneſs with him, that thou
mighteſt not want encouragement, tho a Sinner, yet to cleave to him, to
Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or Fear him? Without Knowledg, neither thy Heart, nor thy Worſhip
can be good. Put thy ſelf on the Tryal all along as we go; the teſt of any
ones Fear of God, and of his Acceptance with him, is one and the ſame; and if
God has no Worſhip from thee, he is not thy fear. But to haſten.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:33235:50"/>
            <p>Again, how ſtandeth thy heart affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted toward God, as to thy
awe of him, and reverence of his Majeſty? <hi>He will not hold him
guiltleſs that ſo much as tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his name in vain,</hi> Exod. 20.7. What
ſhall we think of thoſe then, who have commonly in their mouths, O Lord! O
God! ſo, O Jeſus! without any the leaſt thought or ſenſe of his
glorious Majeſty; yea, who by prophane Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Swearing, do
cuſtomarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and tare the holy Name of God? Can ſuch have any
dread of God on their Soul? Any tenderneſs for him? Let Conſcience ſpeak;
or ſuppoſe thou art ſometimes afraid of his Wrath; yet conſider what a
Temptation of Love haſt thou at the bottom? Doſt thou fear him, and hate
him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. and fly from him; this is not to fear God with
acceptance; even according to thy fear, <hi>ſo will be his wrath againſt
thee,</hi> Pſal. 90.11. if that be all.</p>
            <p>Yet nearer; how ſtands the habitual frame of thy Heart and Soul,
with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the fear of God; hath it point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it towards himſelf and
holineſs, or not? Doeſt thou ſet the Lord always <pb n="94" facs="tcp:33235:51"/>before thee, as the Record and Witneſs of all thy Thoughts and
Actions; his Will as the Rule and Meaſure of them; his Glory as the Scope and
End of them? Do'ſt thou walk in the fear of the Lord all the Day long? Is it
wrought into thy Soul? Doth it influence thee in the whole courſe and tenor
of thy Life? Do it run through all? If not, lay aſide thy pretence to it, or
to acceptance with God. The fear of God is another thing than what many take it
to be; it imports the whole frame of the new Creature, entire Piety and
Godlineſs, and infers it; where it is, all a man doth will ſavour of it;
it's always at hand to govern his Actions, and to keep him ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his
walk with God. Oh, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do their walk witneſs to have no part nor lot
therein! what fruits of it do appear?</p>
            <p>Finally, look back no further than to thoſe few Inſtances
before enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of the works of Righteouſneſs, which do evermore
accompany the fear of God, or that it doth exert it ſelf in, (as it doth in
all other inſtances, if it be true) and what a multitude have we 
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33235:51"/>caſt in that valley of Deciſion, on that teſt
alſo.</p>
            <p>How many are there, who ſcarce pray unto God at all, unleſs in
ſome time of extremity, <hi>howling on their beds of languiſhing,</hi>
Hoſ. 7.14. <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy name, that ſtirreth up
himſelf to take hold of thee,</hi> Iſa. 64.7. How many that do it only for
form-ſake, but ſeldom neither, or that give unto God but the refuſe of
their time and ſtrength, and are indeed weary of it? How many more, with whom
it hath no place in their Families; God dwells not there, nor is his Name
recorded among them, and yet they will hope for acceptance; but God ſpeaks
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that know thee not, and
upon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that call not on thy name,</hi> Jer. 10.25.</p>
            <p>Again, how many, who will riſe early, and ſit up late, to lay
up for their Families and Poſterities, but take no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what become of
their Souls, or to their Nurture in the fear of the Lord; without which yet
they can't deliver their own Souls? We read of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt 
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33235:52"/>of Blood againſt the Watchman, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. It
concerns the Miniſtry, but not them alone; God has committed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a
truſt to the heads of Families, which they muſt be accountable for
likewiſe. <hi>If thou ſpeakeſt not to warn the wicked from his wicked way
to ſave his life, the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity; but his
blood will I require at thine hand,</hi> v. 18. Ch. 33.8. nor is it to be
limited to the guilt of their temporal ruin only. <hi>Wherefore I take you to
record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men,</hi> ſaith the
Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.26. In the ſame caſe, the Soul of another may
be loſt through thy default, and thou mayeſt repent it when it's too late.
But to be careleſs of a mans Family, not to regard of whom it's made up, or
care for their ſpiritual Eſtate, convinceth ſuch Perſons to be
unrighteous, and void of Gods fear. Righteouſneſs conſiſts not in bare
Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: conſult thy own ſtate upon this teſt alſo, whoever thou art
that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>So for Compaſſion, and Miniſtring to the neceſſities of
thoſe who are in want. <hi>But whoſo hath this worlds good, 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33235:52"/>and ſeeth his Brother hath need, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up his
bowels of compaſſion from him; how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> 1
Joh. 3.17. Yea, or the fear of God, who requireth the contrary: Yet, how many
are far from this! <hi>I will be a ſwift witneſs againſt thoſe that
oppreſs the hireling in his wages, the widow and the fatherleſs, and that
turn aſide the ſtranger, and fear not me, ſaith the Lord of hoſts,</hi>
Mal. 3.5. here is quite the contrary, and we ſee how God reſents it. How
many are there that fail in this great Duty? And how many more that do it not
in ſingleneſs of heart, as unto God? And ſo he accepts it not.</p>
            <p>The like and much more may be ſaid as to mens concernment for
the repute of pure religion, or the keeping of a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for it. How many
regard not that, otherwiſe than as their own affectation of the credit
thereof may oblige them to it, if at all? How many, who ſeem to be unwilling
that any others ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their good Name, for Religion and Piety
toward God, but will endeavour to raize it, and are glad to find occaſion, or
make one againſt the ſtricteſt Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it? <hi>Report ſay
they, and we will <pb n="98" facs="tcp:33235:53"/>report it,</hi> Jer. 20.10. But how few
that ſeem really tender for the Name of God concerned even on themſelves,
not to take the liberty to do ought that is, or that may carry the appearance
of evil; whereby, not their Name, but the Name of God may have diſhonour
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon it? Beſides thoſe (that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect not to be over religious,
are aſhamed of it, and covet not any good report for it at all) who will not
pretend to it, nor conſequently are capable of ſcandalizing Religion ſo
much as for the want of it. All things which are ſimply Lawful, may not be
expedient to be done, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23, 24. And whoſo is tinctured with
the fear of God, will have ſome diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exerciſe of Conſcience
therein, and will purſue things lovely, and of good report, as well as things
honeſt, and in their nature juſt; but God knows how few ſuch there be in
the World; the fear of God is no ſuch common thing as ſome take it to
be.</p>
            <p>Let now but the whole be put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſidered; and
wouldeſt thou, whoever thou art, but as impartially look within, and
meaſure thy preſent <pb n="99" facs="tcp:33235:53"/>State and Condition by the ſame
Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard as God will certainly lay Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Line, and
Righteouſneſs to the Plummet, and ſweep away the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of lies, as the
Prophet ſpeaks; in caſe thou do'ſt not, thou mighteſt come to ſome
Concluſion about it, and touching thy everlaſting eſtate, how thy caſe
ſtands in the point of acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>But know, whether thou wilt ſee, or not ſee it, if being
weighed in the former ballance, thou beeſt found wanting in the fear of God,
and working Righteouſneſs, thou art caſt by the ſanction of the
Goſpel of Chriſt, and thereby ſentenced to be in a reprobate ſtate,
<hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.12, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. Expoſtulate the caſe
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now with thy ſelf, and not as they of old did with God, Mal. 1.6.
<hi>But ye ſay, wherein have we deſpiſed thy Name? Wherein have we
polluted thee?</hi> v. 7. The Lord regardeth not the Offering any more; <hi>Yet
ye ſay, wherefore?</hi> Ch. 2.14. <hi>ye have wearied the Lord with your
words; yet ye ſay, wherein have we wearied him? When ye ſay, Every one that
doth evil, is good in the ſight of the Lord, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in them; or
where is the God of <pb n="100" facs="tcp:33235:54"/>judgment?</hi> v. 17. Look to it,
before it be too late, and God anſwers you with a witneſs, <hi>Chap.</hi>
3.5, 16, 18. and don't ſet down in the bare Notion, or hearing of theſe
things, or be like the man that beholds his natural Face in a Glaſs, and
ſtraightway forgetteth what manner of man he was; <hi>Paralogizing,</hi> or
with fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious reaſonings, putting a cheat on your own Souls, as we have
it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Whilſt the word is not ingrafted there,</hi> v.
21. or nothing comes of it; the ſtock is not changed, nor yet the fruit; take
heed that Conviction be not blaſted, and come to no iſſue.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By way of Conſolation and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. Is it of
a Truth, <hi>That in every Nation, he that feareth God, and worketh
Righteouſneſs, is accepted with him?</hi> Is the voice of the Goſpel of
God and our Saviour? Then whoever upon the trial can witneſs within
themſelves, that they are of that number, they may with good warrant
aſſume the comfort thereof, and conclude themſelves juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the
ſight of God, and in favour with him. Art thou one concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the
evidence of thy everlaſting E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, <pb n="101" facs="tcp:33235:54"/>and it may be,
dubious about it? Why, here thou haſt the juſt Character of a ſaved
Perſon, if it may pleaſe God to help thee to diſcern how it is with thee.
Thou art one that believeſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and aſſenteſt to the
Record of God concerning his Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. and haſt betaken thy
ſelf to it, not only as a Revelation worthy of Credit, but alſo worthy of
all Acceptation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Thou truſteth in Chriſt,</hi>
Eph. 1.13. and in God the Father through him; this thou doeſt, ſo far at
leaſt, as to conclude Chriſt Jeſus a Saviour alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee,
and to look to him, and to no other Name for Salvation, ſave unto his alone,
without which thou art not of the Chriſtian Religion, and it's to no
purpoſe to enquire any further for thee; (with us, he that is no Chriſtian,
can be no pious man to be ſure) elſe a bar is already put in againſt
thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. But moreover, <hi>haſt thou counted the
coſt?</hi> Luke 14.28. And conſidered the terms of thy Salvation by
Chriſt, and the Tenor of the Grant thereof; that not Faith only, <hi>But
Godlineſs alſo, hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the life which is to come,</hi> 1
Tim 4.8. <pb n="102" facs="tcp:33235:55"/>(as Death is threatned to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.) haſt thou accounted this alſo <hi>a faithful
ſaying,</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle affirms it to be, <hi>v.</hi> 9, (which
is more hardly believed, for that the fleſh is unwilling to have it true) or
accounted it <hi>worthy</hi> of all <hi>Acceptation,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſubjoyns? How ungrateful ſoever to corrupt Nature, and where the pinch with
us lieth, this comes home to the buſineſs; yet further, art thou one that
truly feareth God? Is his fear in thy heart? Doeſt thou walk in it? A Sinner
thou art; thou dareſt not abide by a ſtrict Tryal, according to the
Original Law of Innocency; thou art ſenſible of thy need of pardoning
Mercy; but art thou a righteous Perſon (not Wicked) <hi>i. e.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
to the Standard of the new Law or Goſpel? Doth the fear of God influence
thee, unto a univerſal and undeſerved Reſignation of thy ſelf up unto
his Will and Commands? Hath it changed the habitual Frame and Diſpoſition
of thy Soul? Is it become the governing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of thy Life? Doth thy
Conſcience witneſs it ſo to be, in the ordinary courſe and tract of thy
Converſation? Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <pb n="103" facs="tcp:33235:55"/>thee from thoſe
Wickedneſſes which would intrench upon Sincerity; and keeping thee ſteady
(in ſome prevalent meaſure) in thy walk, more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with God, and in
all the Duties of thy Place and Calling, in the Station wherein lie hath ſet
thee, as becometh the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Godlineſs, accordingly as hath been
before opened, and I hope ſhall not need here again to be repeated? If I
ſay, this be thy caſe; whatever thy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances otherwaies be, or may
have been; how heinous ſoever thy former Guilt; how dark or doubtful ſoever
thy preſent Condition may remain to thee; Of a truth, I am aſſured that
thou art accepted with God; thou haſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition unto which the Promiſe
is made, and haſt Gods warrant to aſſume there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and to conclude thy
happy eſtate; and God is faithful, and can't deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Truth, his
Word, and he would have thee to take the comfort of it; his Attributes (as hath
been ſhewed) he hath laid at Stake for thy ſecurity; it's a righteous thing
with God, that it ſhould ſo be.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:33235:56"/>
            <p>Are men ſaid to believe unto the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their Souls? ſo
are they ſaid <hi>to repent unto Salvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.10. and unto life,
in the caſe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his houſhold, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18.
and <hi>by patient continuance in well-doing, to ſeek for it,</hi> Rom. 2.7.
and true Piety hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of it. If now <hi>the meſſenger, the
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, one among a thouſand, ſhall ſhew unto thee thy
uprightneſs,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 33.23. tho thou
tookeſt thy ſelf for loſt, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Yet will God be gracious
to thee, for he hath found a ranſom, v.</hi> 24. Lift up thy hands which hang
down, and thy feeble knees! <hi>He will be favourable to thee, and thou ſhalt
ſee his ſave with joy; for he will render unto thee thy
righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> v. 26. Thou ſhalt behold his face in it,
<hi>Pſ.</hi> 17.15. and thou mayeſt truſt to it in its place,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13. How full is the Scripture for thy encouragment? <hi>The
ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his
cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Pſal. 25.14. <hi>Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that
fear him,</hi> Pſ. 33.18. <hi>like as a father pitieth his children, ſo the
Lord pitieth them that fear him,</hi> Pſ. 103.13. <hi>His mercy is from
everlaſting to everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; <pb n="105" facs="tcp:33235:56"/>upon them that fear
him,</hi> v. 17. <hi>To ſuch as keep his Covenant, and to thoſe that
remember his commandments to do them,</hi> v. 18. <hi>when they walk in
darkneſs and have no light, let them truſt in the name of the Lord,</hi>
Iſ. 50.10. <hi>The ſun of righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe unto them, with
healing in his wings,</hi> Mal. 4.2. When <hi>the day of the Lord ſhall burn
as an Oven againſt all the proud, and all that do wickedly ſhall be as
ſtubble,</hi> v. 1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, that
delighteth greatly in his commandments,</hi> Pſ. 112.1. <hi>The righteous
ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance,</hi> v. 6. <hi>He ſhall not be
afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord,</hi> v. 7.
<hi>Say to the righteous, it ſhall be well with him,</hi> Iſa. 5.10.
<hi>The work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the effect of
righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſurance for ever,</hi> Ch. 32.17. And
what more can be ſaid? <hi>O how great is thy goodneſs, which thou haſt
laid up for them that fear thee,</hi> Pſal. 31.19. No man is warranted to
truſt to the Grace of God in Chriſt, that abides an unrighteous Perſon;
but he that truſteth to his own righteouſneſs; (if indeed he be
righteous) namely, that God will <pb n="106" facs="tcp:33235:57"/>accept him thereupon;
it's an inſtance of his truſt to the Grace of God, to the Blood of
Chriſt, and to the Promiſe of the Goſpel in their place alſo; for the
one is no way inconſiſtent with the other, but incluſive of it; and God
is to be truſted of his word. Hence the Godly have appealed, and may do unto
God for his favour on that plea, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.20.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. (as they were ſure, that if they had it not, they ought
not to expect it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12.) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.1. Tho it's not the
Portion of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to be able ſo to diſcern the Work of God on
their Souls, as that they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be capable of pleading it; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
not of thoſe whoſe Progreſs is ſo ſmall; that it's hard to diſcover
any change ſcarce in them: Yet is it pleada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where it is diſcernable,
and the God of Mercy will admit it; the word is gone out of his Mouth. Well
then, <hi>If thy heart condemn thee not,</hi> upon a due ſcrutiny and
ſearch into this matter, then mayeſt <hi>thou have confidence towards
God,</hi> thou haſt his word for it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21. If thou feareſt
him, and workeſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, thou art and ſhall be accepted 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33235:57"/>with him. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son
cleanſeth,</hi> or abſolveth <hi>thee from all Sin,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
1.7. and ſo will the Judg at laſt pronounce of thee, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.35,
46.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It remaineth only to improve the Truth aſſerted, by
way of Exhortation, Counſel and Direction, and ſo to draw to a
Concluſion. Is it ſo, that they and they only <hi>that fear God, and work
righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, are accepted with God?</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation then is, to a
thorough and ſpeedy coming up to the ſame Duty, and it concerns two
ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Such as upon a Reflection on the frame and temper of
their heart, and courſe of their life, may from what hath been ſaid, find
reaſon to conclude, or ſuſpect that as yet they are ſhort of the fear
of God, and true Piety, or the Character of a Perſon in favour with God. This
is no condition for thy Soul to reſt one moment in, if that be thy caſe;
yea, if thou but ſuſpect; it's to ſleep as on the top of a Maſt, on the
very brink of Ruin for ever. Let me therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate upon thee, the
neceſſity and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of thy compliance, with the 
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33235:58"/>call of God unto thee in the Text. <hi>As I live, ſaith
the Lord God, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the wicked, but that the
wicked turn from his way and live,</hi> Ezek. 33.11. Why will ye dye? What
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ſame ſay I unto thee;
<hi>What now doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy
God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ſerve him with all thy
heart, and with all thy Soul?</hi> Deut. 10.12. <hi>To keep the commandments of
the Lord, and his ſtatutes which he hath commanded thee for thy good,</hi> v.
13. What haſt thou to except againſt theſe terms? Are they not equal? Is
not the thing it ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee, for thy good, if nothing more did
depend on it? Was not the fear of God, and the Impreſs of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
upon the Soul of man, the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive perfection of his Nature? How comes it to
paſs then, that now, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving, or bringing of it again into thy Soul,
ſhould not be accounted for its good? Yea, God be hardly thought of, as if he
meant ill to mankind, or would abridg him of what is for his good, in laying
this reſtraint upon him? This <pb n="109" facs="tcp:33235:58"/>Suggeſtion does but
ſhew, how deeply an Averſation unto God and Holineſs, has rivetted its
ſelf into the nature of lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man, with a potent Inclination to all Sin,
as if a man could not live one good day without it. In the mean while, if this
be thy arguing, or theſe thy inward thoughts; what Notion haſt thou of the
future ſtate, or condition of thoſe who are accepted with God? No man can
be happy againſt his will or liking. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſts in the
pleaſure that ariſes from the harmonious agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Object and
the Appetite; and the ſight of Gods face, and the aſſimilation of the
Soul unto him in the perfection of Holineſs, are the conſtituent parts of
it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. If then thou ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreſt from
this, and diſguſts it, Heaven it ſelf can be no State of happineſs for
thee, if indeed without a change firſt made in the temper of thy heart and
ſoul, it were poſſible for thee to have thy lot there; Abſolutely thou
canſt not deſire it, but <hi>Hypothetically</hi> only, or for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
on the ſuppoſal that thou muſt dye, and can enjoy the pleaſure of Sin
and the World no longer, as of two Evils to <pb n="110" facs="tcp:33235:59"/>chuſe the
leaſt, Heaven rather than Hell at laſt; a ſad <hi>Omen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is it that thou wouldeſt have or deſire, (to be the
terms of thy acceptance with God, I can't call it, but) that with a <hi>non
obſtante,</hi> thou mighteſt find favour with God, or be ſaved from Wrath
to come? What, that he would recede from his eſtabliſhment, and not
inſiſt on his Fear, or ſuch ſtrict Piety, or works of Righteouſneſs
in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? That is as much as to ſay, thou wouldeſt have
Elbow-room for the Fleſh, and Indulgence to affront the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty,
and contemn his Laws, to caſt off all fear and regard of God, to pay him no
Homage or Service all thy days, and yet to be ſaved by him at laſt. Let
conſcience now ſpeak (if thou beeſt not given up to a Reprobate
ſenſe) were this becoming the Holy God, and Rector of the World? No, God
will not reſign his Government, or revoke the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Goſpel
for thee. I know here it pinches, but thou wilt find it true, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
flatter not thy ſelf with the hopes of the contrary, but conſider, and
ſet thy ſelf to the Work and Duty God calleth thee unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:33235:59"/>
            <p>Yet further, let it be reminded, which hath been laid down before,
and is proper for thee here to make uſe of, that tho thou art a Sinner, and
mayeſt as yet have no ground of pretence to Gods favour, yet art thou not in
a remedileſs Eſtate. The firſt Tranſgreſſion concludes thee not.
Here then is infinite Mercy, that on any terms thou mayeſt be reſtored to a
ſtate of Acceptance with God, which thou hadſt once forfeited; that thou
haſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſt for Eternity: it was not ſo with the Angels that fell,
<hi>Jud.</hi> 6. Here is then a foundation of encouragement: There is
forgiveneſs with God for thee, that he may be feared by thee. Thou art a
<hi>Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the pit, wherein is no water,</hi> no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, Zech.
9.11. <hi>Yet a Priſoner of hope through the blood of the covenant,</hi> v.
12. Chriſt died for thee, and God is propitious towards thee on his ſcore;
he can with ſafety to his Honour, and the repute of his law be juſt and
righteous, and yet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee, and receive thee to favour, <hi>Rom.</hi>
3.25, 26. on the terms propoſed to thee; ſo runs the preamble of our
Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Commiſſion, and that which in the firſt place we are to
declare, To wit, <hi>that <pb n="112" facs="tcp:33235:60"/>God was in Chriſt reconciling
the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them,</hi> 2
Cor. 5.19. that is, as to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration</hi> thereof, doing what
belonged to him, as to ſo much as concerned the ſufficiency of the ranſom
toward an actual Reconciliation, whereupon our Embaſſage is bottomed,
<hi>v.</hi> 20. I don't ſay that thou art immediately to believe thy ſins
to be forgiven thee; for that may be a lye, and is ſo, if thou feareſt not
God: Nor do I ſay, that thou art bound only to believe that there is
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with God for them that do, or ſhall fear him; for they are
then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually forgiven; but that there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with him for thee,
<hi>i. e.</hi> a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to pardon, antecedently to thy fear of him, as
the motive to it, whether thou finally accepteſt, or refuſeſt it, or the
terms of it; <hi>trampling under foot the Son of God, and deſpiſing the
blood of the covenant,</hi> Heb. 10.29. Defeating thy ſelf of its advantage;
ſtill there was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with him for thee; otherwiſe, he would not
have ſent to thee an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage of Reconciliation, or therein have
preſcribed his fear unto thee, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <pb n="113" facs="tcp:33235:60"/>to it; that
ſtumbling-ſtone is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore removed out of thy way.</p>
            <p>Yea moreover, ſo ſure it is, that the belief of the Atonement
made for thee by the Sacrifice of Chriſt, ſo far as to render God
appeaſable towards thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. as alſo the belief of thy
actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al acceptance with him on the ſame ſcore, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. So ſoon
as thou ſhalt entertain the terms, or receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the atonement,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. Is now become the leading condition of the Goſpel, and
indiſpenſibly neceſſary to life, firſt to be admitted as true, and
worthy of all acceptation, before any farther treaty with thee can be had
touching thy acceptance with God; it behoveth thee therefore to mind it.</p>
            <p>The fear of God, and working righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, compriſeth all
the reſt that God doth require of thee. <hi>We pray you in Chriſts ſtead,
be ye reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.2. Thy ſins may have been as ſcarlet
and crimſon, of a dye or tincture on the account of ſome aggravating
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances greatly inhauncing their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and demerit; but <hi>come
now, ſaith the Lord, for all that, and let us reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> 
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:33235:61"/>Iſa. 11.18. Say not, <hi>wherewith ſhall I come before
the Lord? Will he be pleaſed with thouſands of rams, or with ten
thouſands of Rivers of Oil? Shall I give my firſt-born for my
tranſgreſſion?</hi> Mic. 6.7. No, God has found a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. <hi>He hath
ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth he require of thee, but to do
juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> v. 8. to fear
him; and obey him.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, if thou wouldeſt begin at the right end, look to
get thy Heart and Soul poſſeſſed with the fear of God, that is the very
beginning of Wiſdom, as it imports a thorough change, habitually determining
the whole man toward God and Holineſs. Here lies the root of the matter;
without it nothing can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to God, or be truly Religious; ſome
partial and ſuperficial Change or Reformation may be had, or attained unto,
and ſomething effected or done more than formerly; but nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it,
that may denominate thee a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Perſon. Nay, it's ten to one, but that
at one time or other, thou wilt get looſe again from thy convictions and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, <pb n="115" facs="tcp:33235:61"/>whilſt thou roweſt againſt the
ſtream and tide of thy native inclination, tugged on by a kind of force from
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, deſtitute of the Spirit, without the new Nature, or any holy
diſpoſition or tendency towards God. <hi>Thy goodneſs will be but as a
morning cloud, and as the early dew will it go away,</hi> Hoſ. 6.4. and in
the mean while thou liveſt not to God, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11.</p>
            <p>In the next place, look to thy walk, thy fruits; That they be
<hi>the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt, to the
glory and praiſe of God,</hi> Phil. 1.11. <hi>The wicked muſt forſake his
way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and return unto the Lord, or there
is no mercy for him,</hi> Iſa. 55.7. Be exhorted then in the fear of God,
<hi>that thou putteſt off concerning thy former converſation, the old man,
with its deceitful luſts, and let thy converſation witneſs thee to have
put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true
holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.22, 24. Talk not of thy heart, or good meanings
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, whilſt the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil bave thy
ſervice. <hi>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your ſelves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33235:62"/>to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey,</hi> Rom.
6.16. <hi>Herein the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the
Devil: whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs, is not of God,</hi> 1 John
3.10.</p>
            <p>For a motive or argument enforcing the word of Exhortation, take
that of the Text. Thy acceptance with God, or eternal Rejection by him, is
immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſuſpended thereon; be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this point. <hi>See, I
have ſet before thee this day, life and good, and death and evil: in that I
command thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to
keep his commandments,</hi> Deut. 30.15, 16. <hi>The word is very nigh unto
thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayeſt do it,</hi> v. 14.
(this was the voice of the Goſpel to lapſed man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 8.)
<hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy
ſeed, to love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul,
that thou mayeſt live,</hi> v. 6. The two Tables of the Law did ever enter
the Covenant of Life ſtruck with fallen man; termed thence the <hi>Tables of
the Teſtament or Covenant,</hi> Chap. 9.11. made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in
the Blood of Chriſt, <pb n="117" facs="tcp:33235:62"/>in the Type, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.7.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17, 18. Thou art inexcuſable who ever thou art, if ever
thou didſt read in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or hear the ſound of the Goſpel, and
haſt taken no notice of this, That Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the Life
to come, and that without it no man ſhall ſee the Lord, or find Acceptance
with him. It's then a matter of no ſmall moment unto thee, whether thou
obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the call of God this day unto thee, or not. Thy Soul lies at ſtake
on it; thou haſt the promiſe of God on the one hand, to invite and
encourage thee; if but thy own Life, eternal Life, may bear any weight with
thee, till thou beeſt capable of ſeeing ſomething higher. Is Gods favour
not worthy acceptance or regard, when in it is Life? Again, on the other hand,
if thou wilt none of the fear of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.29. to cleave to
him, and ſerve him, he will be thy fear, and thy dread another day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou wilt or no, to thy confuſion, <hi>v.</hi> 7. when thou wouldeſt be
glad to have a hiding place in the Rock, or to lye buried in the duſt,
<hi>for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty,</hi> 
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:33235:63"/>Iſa. 2.10. be thy greatneſs now what it will,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15. <hi>For the great day of his wrath to come, and who ſhall
be able to ſtand?</hi> v. 17. <hi>The ſinners in</hi> Zion <hi>are afraid,
fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites; who among us ſhall dwell with
the devouring fire, who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting
burnings?</hi> Iſa. 33.14. <hi>He that walketh righteouſly, &amp;c.</hi> v.
15. None other ſhall dwell on high, but <hi>their heart ſhall meditate
terror,</hi> Heb. 18.12, 13.</p>
            <p>Nor do thou cheat thy ſelf here, in the hopes that the
righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſhall excuſe thee, or ſtand thee in ſtead
to anſwer the demands of the Goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of thee the fear of God,
and the perſonal righteouſneſs whereof we have been ſpeaking. Chriſt
hath anſwered the demands of the Law of Works; but where doeſt thou read
that he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in thy room or ſtead, to Believe, to Repent, to
Love and Fear God, and work Righteouſneſs, or obey the Goſpel, ſo as to
render thee capable of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God unto Life without them? No, it's of
thee that the Goſpel requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all this, as the condition of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33235:63"/>in, or title to the advantages of the purchaſe of
Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Ch.</hi> 9.15. And if thou faileſt, or
falleſt ſhort of this Goſpel righteouſneſs, thou art wholly left
remedileſs for ever; there is no third Covenant to relieve thee againſt the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.
Chriſt came into the World to lay a foundation for the love and fear of God,
and obedience to him; not to render it unneceſſary to his favour; mind
therefore thy Duty, and look up to God for help, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. and
forget not to have an eye unto Chriſt alſo, as the Spring and Fountain of
that Grace thou yet wanteſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Here it may be thou mayeſt after all that hath been
ſaid, be objecting and reaſoning thus within thy ſelf, What I muſt do
to be accepted with God, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſaved, I know, that is out of
queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with me. But what ſhall I do for the</hi> Grace <hi>enjoyned me
to have,</hi> whereby I may ſerve the Lord acceptably with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and
godly fear? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. <hi>How is this poſſible unto me? Here my
feet ſtick as in the miry clay. Some Conviction <pb n="120" facs="tcp:33235:64"/>of the
Truth I have, but like one in a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; I know my thirſt after ſin and
fleſh-pleaſing is my Diſeaſe, and that if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, it will prove
mortal to me; but for all that, I can't quench it, nor reſiſt its
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. An Alienation from God, and ſtrict Godlineſs, I find rooted
in my mind, and the Fleſh preponderating me the other way, notwithſtanding
my Conviction, and the various Impreſſions I ſtruggle under. What now
ſhall I do? ſo far forth as Grace is poſſible to me, ſo far is it
poſſible for me to be ſaved, and no further. To ſay, That God can
change my Nature, and diſpoſe me to his Fear, is true; but nothing to my
caſe, whilſt he doth it not. Is it attainable by me in any means uſing,
ſo as that it muſt lye at my door, if I have it not? If it be ſo, let me
know what the Goſpel ſaith, if any Conſtitution there be, any Treaty with
lapſed man concerning it. Whether there be any promiſe thereof on any terms
ever once made, or any thing that lies before me to be done in order to it,
aſcertaining it to me in the uſe of means, without which I may be
remedileſs for ought that I know, or is revealed, without any relief by the
Goſpel; what hope is there left?</hi> Jer. 10.12.</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:33235:64"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To preſs upon the Sinner the neceſſity of
the new Creature, or change of the frame and temper of his Spirit, and courſe
of his Life, without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of incouragement reſpecting the
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of attaining to it, can only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, not at all relieve him,
I grant; ſuppoſing it every way abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unto him. No
Argument can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be pleaded to urge thereunto in ſuch caſe, nor
could any mans heart reproach him for the not having of it.</p>
            <p>Nor will that well-meant Diſtinction, of a <hi>Natural</hi> and
<hi>Moral</hi> Impotency, or <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> rather, help our here;
the meaning whereof is no more, than that man notwithſtanding the entrance of
ſin, is not deſtitute of any <hi>natural</hi> Faculty, Power or Capacity,
to the Reception of Grace, or the Exerciſe of it; but is <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
only incapacitated unto it, <hi>i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> e.</hi> from an <hi>inſuperable</hi>
Averſation thereunto, and <hi>Propenſion</hi> to the contrary, rooted in
the Mind and Will. Hence it's ſaid, that ſince mans Impotency or Incapacity
of turning unto God, and working Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, is not ſuch, as that he
<hi>cannot</hi> if he would; but conſiſts rather in this, 
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:33235:65"/>that he <hi>Wills</hi> it not, he affects not to be Holy:
that is no excuſe therefore, why he is not changed; for that it's what he
<hi>chuſes;</hi> he might be better if he would. He has the <hi>natural</hi>
Power, or poſſibility unto it, tho not the <hi>moral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſtinction has its uſe; but it reaches not the Solution
of the preſent Difficulty. It ſhews indeed where the Diſeaſe lies,
namely, in the <hi>elective</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Soul; not barely in its
execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power, but in the firſt Digeſtion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and imports no more
but that man is yet <hi>habile ſubjectum,</hi> a ſubject capable of having
Grace, (and ſo he is of ſpotleſs Perfection) he is not deſtitute of any
natural Faculty, that is, he is man ſtill, with his faculties of vital Power,
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Will; but wants the well-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſedneſs only of them, that
for all that, he can't be a good man. But the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of the
<hi>elicit</hi> acts of the Mind and Will, <hi>viz:</hi> whether the
unregenerate man can obtain of himſelf, <hi>ſimply,</hi> to ſenſe or
ſavour the things of God, or to will and to do what is well-pleaſing in his
ſight, without the Divine help, <hi>ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating</hi> 
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:33235:65"/>his natural Faculties, healing their Diſtemper, and new
diſpoſing and determining them towards God and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. This in the
Objection is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that truly, to be <hi>immediately</hi>
impoſſible unto him, and in the Solution by the former Diſtinction to be
<hi>morally</hi> ſo; and why not <hi>naturally</hi> alſo? Since the
diſaſter is not only now <hi>congenite</hi> to fall'n man, but withal,
according to the Inſtitution of Nature, it's <hi>naturally</hi>
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the mind or will, till it be firſt rectified and changed,
to exert, or put forth any act in the mean while, againſt its radicated
<hi>inſuperable</hi> Inclination, or unto which it's deſtitute of any
Principle, Aptitude or Diſpoſition, as for the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> to
change his Skin, as the Prophet expreſſes it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. And if
this be ſo, and no more can be anſwered or ſaid; ſtill the difficulty
remains, what Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation man can juſtly have to a new Law introduced,
binding him to a natural impoſſibility, (or call it moral, it comes to the
ſame) or what relief the new Covenant can deſign, in propoſing and
enjoyning happineſs unto Sinners, whilſt the terms are impoſſible (not
to God, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:33235:66"/>but) to them, as to ſtop the courſe of the Sun
in the Firmament. How is this a Law of Grace to them, if it be ſo?</p>
            <p>But in Anſwer to the Objection, and for the further vindicating
of the Truth, I muſt here diſtinguiſh between that which is
<hi>mediately</hi> and <hi>ultimately</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the Creature, or
impoſſible, and what is <hi>nextly</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> ſo. In
the latter Senſe, in the caſe of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> 2
<hi>Kin.</hi> 5. the cure of his Leproſie was to him abſolutely
impoſſible, nor could any one elſe but God do it, <hi>v.</hi> 7. It was a
Miracle; (and no leſs power is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the cleanſing away the
Leproſie, and Contagion of Sin) but in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in
the uſe of the means, or direction given him by the Prophet, <hi>v.</hi> 10.
by the force of Gods Promiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified to him, it was more than poſſible
to him. His recovery was equally within his Power, as was his waſhing ſeven
times in <hi>Jordan.</hi> Yea, and if he was not recovered, it lay peremptorily
at his door, and it was ten to one that it proved not ſo, <hi>v.</hi> 13. And
yet, when the cure was done, for all that he did his part; yet in his
conſcience he could not but <pb n="125" facs="tcp:33235:66"/>aſcribe it in the whole,
unto the ſole Power and Goodneſs of God, to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction thereof beyond
whatever he had before, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 17. ſo is the caſe here, and the
Application to it is eaſie.</p>
            <p>More particularly and plainly; for I am not here diſputing; if
thou beeſt in earneſt, whoever thou art that objecteſt thus within thy
ſelf; let me come yet cloſer up to thee. And firſt let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,
which in the Objection is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted. (1.) That thou ſtandeſt at
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent convinced of the abſolute neceſſity of a change of thy Heart
and Life, (the whole need not the Phyſitian) and that without it the favour
of God is unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by thee. (2.) That without the Divine help,
illuminating thy mind, and renewing it, altering the Biaſs and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of thy Will, and implanting the fear of God in thy heart, thou can'ſt not
diſpoſe thy ſelf unto holineſs; this thou art ſenſible of, and the
Scriptures ſpeak the ſame, and directs thee to look up to God for it,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, 45. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Eph.</hi>
2.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17, 18. hold
thee then there. (3.) How pleaſant ſoever Sin <pb n="126" facs="tcp:33235:67"/>may as
yet be to thee, and hard to part with, (if thou wilt ſpeak out) how
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie ſoever the yoke of Chriſt may ſeem to thee, who wert never as
yet accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed unto it: Yet knowing it to be thy diſeaſe, and reflecting
on the danger of it; thou ſayeſt, that thou art not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to be healed.
Thou knoweſt the Will of God, and art ſo far enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, as to have
ſome taſt of his good Word, and approveſt the things that are more
excellent: Take heed then of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back again this ſtep toward
Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Some are moſt deſperately bent againſt it, and averſe to
any treaty about it. <hi>They have refuſed to return,</hi> Jer. 5.3. by a
poſitive act of their will. <hi>Wo unto thee, O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>wilt
thou not be made clean? when ſhall it once be?</hi> Ch. 13.27. Matt. 23.37.
that is not abſolutely thy caſe. (4.) Thou art ſenſible that God,
<hi>de novo,</hi> enjoyns thee to fear him, and walk uprightly before him, in
order to his favour, notwithſtanding thy former forfeiture, and that he
knoweth perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy preſent frame, and what can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be expected
from thee. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thee to <hi>circumciſe thy heart to love 
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33235:67"/>and to fear him,</hi> Deur 10. Yea, <hi>to make thee a new
heart, and a new ſpirit,</hi> Ezek. 18. to be a new man; and that under a new
Penalty, and more ſore than was that of the Law of Innocency, <hi>Heb.</hi>
2.3. and 10.29 But withal, declaring his hearty willingneſs rather that thou
ſhouldeſt repent and turn to him, than periſh under that double guilt for

            <p>Now that it may appear to thy own Senſe and Conſcience, that
the Holy and Gracious God doth not mock thee in all this, but intends thy

<hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. which belongs

an improper ſenſe. That belongs only to the elect, and amounts not to a
promiſe claimable by all, or any ſingular perſon in particular. It's
indeed directive, whither to go for help, and from whom all grace is to be
received; but the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God revealed that he will give it to ſome
indefinitely, is extrinſical to the nature of a Law; it's not mans fault that
he is not the object of ſuch abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor ſhall it be the
rule of Gods Judgment, when he ſhall be condemned for his failing of the
Grace of God, whereof we are enquiring, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15, 17.</p>
            <p>The Law of God, reſpecting the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Soul of man
unto his loſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age (without which he can't be happy) conſiſts of three
parts. The Precept, the Promiſe, and the Threat.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Preceptive</hi> part. It can't be denied, but
that ſomething in the way of <pb n="130" facs="tcp:33235:69"/>Duty is incumbent on the
Sinner, to the end, that he may be converted and healed, and this is his means
to be uſed in order to it; and may be reduced to two heads (1.) Something
reſpecting God more immediately as the Author of Grace, or the giver of it;
ſuch are the reading of the Scriptures, attending on the ordinances of God;
eſpecially the Miniſtry of the word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. and Prayer unto
God by Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. frequenting good company, <hi>&amp;c.
Pro.</hi> 13.20. God commandeth that the Creature meeting him, <hi>quantum in
ſe,</hi> ſo far as in it lieth, in the way of his Grace. <hi>There is none
that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee,</hi> Iſa. 64.7. (2.)
Something reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubject to be wrought upon, as namely, the
avoiding of thoſe Sins, which it's capable of a reſtraint from, and which
in their own nature tend to increaſe the habitual ſtrength of Sin by
cuſtome, and to render Converſion more difficult, this God commands, And
withal, to come up to thoſe Duties of Juſtice, Mercy, countenancing and
following after that which is honeſt and good, in the due im provement of
every Talent received, <pb n="131" facs="tcp:33235:69"/>and which in its own nature is
diſpoſitive unto a change yet further, (tho not <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus in re,</hi> any
degree as yet in that which is ſaving) as a body organized is in a nearer
Diſpoſition to be animated with a rational Soul, than a meer lump of Clay.
This God requires by Precept of man, in order to his recovery to Grace and
Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is ſavingly ſuch, that he be in the way of it.</p>
            <p>Now, that of all this is impoſſible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, who makeſt
the Objection? Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is preſuppoſed to Morality; and whilſt God
ſuſtaineth thy being, and ſupplies thee with his common Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. this thou can'ſt do.</p>
            <p>Mans Capacity unto the Reception of Grace, or Renovation unto the
Image of God, is not meerly <hi>Logical</hi> or <hi>Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> like to
that of a Stock or a Stone, (tho in ſome ſenſe worſe) as hath been
ſaid. He hath ſtill his natural Faculties abiding, rendring him immediately
fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceptible of it, and it is but their recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or new
well-diſpoſedneſs unto Holineſs. And conſequently, alſo he can
uſe his Faculties which are reaſonable, with deſign for the bettering of
his eſtate, <pb n="132" facs="tcp:33235:70"/>in the way of Gods Ordination, and can do
ſomething in order to it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.34. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24.</p>
            <p>Neither yet is all the Ignorance of men invincible, nor all their
Averſation unto the ways of God and Holineſs inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable. The mind can
reflect, and fetch in Intelligence of the danger; it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and keep
guard: More violence can men uſe with themſelves than they do,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.19. their <hi>cannot</hi> here, is no more or other than
that of his who ſaid he could not riſe, and give his Friend, <hi>Luke</hi>
11.7. that is, he could not without ſome difficulty, and great
unwillingneſs, get his mind to it; who yet upon his importunity did do it,
<hi>v.</hi> 8. All mankind have <hi>recognized</hi> this Power in their
Conſtitution of human Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt moral Impieties. No juſt Law can be
made that ſhould bind men to moral Impoſſibilities, or to what is not
within the Power of any one, till he be firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and in a ſtate
of Salvation. No man doth think but than when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors are found guilty,
and adjudged to Penalties for their Crimes, they might and could have done
otherwiſe, and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know <pb n="133" facs="tcp:33235:70"/>it is ſo. In ſhort, thou

Hear, Read, Pray, give Alms, and come up to the external Acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
both Perſonal, Family, and Publick; and can'ſt forbear this or that act of
groſs Sin, ſuch as Murder, Theft, Adultery, Lying, Cheating, Swearing,
Drunkenneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> men ſhort of ſaving Grace have done it, and
may do it, through the knowledg alſo and belief of the Lord, and Saviour
Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. and yet be again intangled in the
ſame Pollutions of the World, if they look not to it, <hi>v.</hi> 22.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20. Yea, and further, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God changeth or choverteth any
one, it's in a way congruous to his Nature, and the Soul goes along in the
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of its Faculties, which it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, like as when our Saviour
was about to cure the man of his withered hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. he bids him
ſtretch it forth; and not without reaſon might he be did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lift at it,
for that he had the firſt Power and Faculty of it, and he muſt eſſay,
whilſt Omnipotency healed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of the Organ, and produced
the effect. Still ſomething in the way of <pb n="134" facs="tcp:33235:71"/>Duty (yet not
impoſſible to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is enjoyned thee in order to thy cure, if thou
wilt be made whole. Yea, and thou muſt work, if ever thou expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt God to
help thee to will, or to do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor is there a bare command, but withal there is a
promiſe of Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the forementioned precepts, either
expreſſed or implyed; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituteth it a Covenant, and alone
renders the former Duties complied with, proper means to be uſed by us, unto
Grace. <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Luke</hi> 8. It's accommodated to the parable of the ſower, and brought
in as a reaſon, inforcing the caution given by him to take heed how they
hear, <hi>v.</hi> 18. And again, <hi>take therefore the Talent from him,</hi>
Mat. 25.28. <hi>for unto every one that hath, ſhall be given,</hi> v. 29.
that is, to everyone that rightly uſeth, or improveth his Talent received,
will God give more; <hi>in diverſo genere,</hi> it muſt be meant of the
Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of ſaving Grace that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſpeaks, as is evident in
the main ſcope of the Parable. It's paſt doubt, that the wicked and
ſlothful Servant <pb n="135" facs="tcp:33235:71"/>was condemned for the want of Truth of
Grace, or of that, which had it been gained, had been rewardable with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life; if not, his caſe had been the ſame, he had periſhed
notwithſtanding: If ſo, his Plea is conſiderable, and no man can object
more: <hi>I knew thee, Lord, ſaith he, that thou art an hard man, reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
where thou haſt not ſowen, gathering where thou haſt not ſtrawed,</hi>
v. 24. <hi>q. d.</hi> If I am ſentenced for the not gaining or having that,
the Seed or Power whereof was never once perſonally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto me; the which
he alledgeth himſelf before to have been aware of, and therefore was
diſcouraged or afraid, but could not help it: See now the Anſwer, <hi>Thou
oughteſt therefore to have put my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Exchangers, i. e.</hi> have
improved the Talent I betruſted thee with, and then thou ſhouldeſt have
gained that, for the want of which I now doom thee as an unprofitable Servant,
like to that, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.11. <hi>If therefore ye have not been faithful
in the unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your truſt the true
riches?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet further, that it is the Duty of all men to ſeek the Lord,
and to pray unto <pb n="136" facs="tcp:33235:72"/>him for Grace, is out of all queſtion;
but whoever cometh to God, is expreſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to believe, not only that he
is, <hi>but that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb.
11.6. without which no foundation or motive of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement doth remain. Now
Faith can't ſtand alone without a bottom; what warrant can any man have to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in ſuch a caſe, that which God hath not promiſed? Either they
have Gods word for it, or they can't be bound to believe it. Faith is an
aſſent upon Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that is its <hi>formal</hi> Nature; and the thing
teſtified, namely, that God is a rewarder, (yea, in the very caſe in hand,
<hi>Luke</hi> 11.10.) doth not tranſcend the faculty of the natural Man, to
yield his aſſent thereunto, as the foundation of his Application unto God
for the Grace that he wants. <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask of
God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be
given him,</hi> Jam. 1.5. <hi>but let him ask in Faith,</hi> v. 6. <hi>Draw
nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you: cleanſe your hands ye
Sinners,</hi> Jam. 4.8. moſt expreſs is that, Prov. 2.3, 4, 5. <hi>If thou
crieſt after <pb n="137" facs="tcp:33235:72"/>knowledg, and lifteſt up thy voice for
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then ſhalt thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the fear of
the Lord, and find the knowledg of God.</hi> The fear of God is the thing in my
Text required unto his favour: And here the Diſpenſation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is made
conditional, and the tenor of the new Covenant, with reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
expreſſed. As alſo in the former Chapter; on the ſame foot of account;
it's put upon every mans election or choice, and laid there that they do not
fear God, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.29. for that they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not aſſurance of help
from God, <hi>v.</hi> 23. if they had not rejected it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded his
methods unto it, <hi>v.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is moreover a Threat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this
Conſtitution. It's no bare Counſel, but has the force of a Law, which
ſerves further to confirm what is before aſſerted. Every Threat doth
vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually include a promiſe to the contrary, in any eſtabliſhment. The
Precept in Conjunction with the Sanction, in caſe of diſobedience, Gen.
2.17. <hi>For in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye;</hi>
is all that we have upon Record, touching the firſt Covenant eſtabliſhed 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33235:73"/>with man. Yet, is it hence concluded, that a promiſe of
Life unto <hi>Adam,</hi> in caſe he continued in his obedience, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be
doubted; for that it muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, tho tacitly included in the
Threat.</p>
            <p>The Commination or Threat here, is the denial of Grace, a
Dereliction of God, a judicial blinding and hardening, the taking away of
former Talents miſ-improved, and leaving the Soul in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-incapacity of
Grace, as now paſt it. How full is the Scripture in this point? <hi>From him
ſhall be taken away, even that he hath,</hi> Mat. 13.12. <hi>leſt at any
time they ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them,</hi> v. 15. When God
commands the uſe of means in order to the further communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Grace
unto men, that they do what they can do: If now they will not ſeek unto God,
but ſet themſelves down in a ſupine ſloth and negligence, at beſt; or
ſpeaking evil of thoſe things which they know not: what they know
natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as bruit Beaſts, in thoſe things they will corrupt
themſelves, as <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks; affronting the Divine Majeſty,
grieving his Spirit, reſiſting it, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. <pb n="139" facs="tcp:33235:73"/>debauching their own Conſciences, and quenching the Spirit
ſtriving therein with them; then he threatens to give them up. Iſrael
<hi>would none of me: ſo I gave them up to their hearts luſt,</hi> Pſ.
81.12. <hi>O that my people had hearkened to me,</hi> v. 13. <hi>God gave them
over to a reprobate mind,</hi> Rom. 1.28. <hi>that they ſhould believe a lie,
that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in
unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.11, 12. <hi>Now they are hid from thine
eyes,</hi> Luke 19.42. thy day is paſt. <hi>I will put a new Spirit within
you,</hi> Ezek. 11.19. <hi>but as for them, whoſe heart walketh after their
abominations, I will recompence their way upon their own head,</hi> v. 21.
Zech. 7.11, 13. <hi>The bellows are burnt, the lead is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, i. e.</hi>
the coſt is loſt: <hi>Reprobate ſilver ſhall men call them, becauſe
the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> Jer. 6.29. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be purged
from thy filthineſs any more, till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon
thee,</hi> Ezek. 24.12, 13. <hi>My Spirit ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtrive with
man,</hi> Gen. 6.3.</p>
            <p>It's true, that the Threat here doth not every way run parallel
with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. In the Promiſe, God hath laid an <pb n="140" facs="tcp:33235:74"/>Obligation on himſelf, when the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is performed. But the
Threat carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it but the nature of a penal Law, which in its due
Conſtruction, tho it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth the Sinner unto its Penalty in caſe of
forfeiture; yet it bindeth not the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver unto Execution in ſuch caſe.
God has, as Supream Governour, for weighty Reaſon, reſerved to himſelf
his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Royal, as to the Execution of the Threat, (and the timing of
it, when he doth it) as was hinted in the opening of the Text. Sometimes he has
foretold that he will, and we find actually that he hath ſtept out of the
courſe of his ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law, and prevented ſome in the way of
diſcriminating Mercy, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.14, 15. (without wrong to any other in
the like circumſtances) whoſe undoubted right it is, to have in his
diſpoſal ſome ſpecial grace and favour, (which no mortal but has) to
beſtow on whom he pleaſes: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that noted ſaying of
<hi>Proſper, Deus neminem deſerit,</hi> &amp;c. God leaves none, till they
forſake him, and many ſuch, he often converts. But in the mean while, when
ever he does it, the Sinner had no warrant to expect it, or to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture 
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33235:74"/>on it, (which were to ſin, that way might be made for
diſcriminating Grace to abound) no man has any ground to believe that God
will convert him out of the way and method preſcribed unto him, in order to
it. How many may have periſhed on that Preſumption, and that by their own
wilful neglect; whilſt they well knew, that in the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
pardoning Grace and Acceptance unto Life; God hath not reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
any the like liberty of Superſedure, to ſave any one, who by a previous
work of ſanctifying Grace on his Soul, is not afore prepared unto Glory,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23, 24. and therefore it muſt be a madneſs to adventure
it.</p>
            <p>Now then, Soul, if that be ſo, and this be thy caſe, ſay
now, whether God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth any impoſſibility of thee? or whether no relief
was indeed offered thee in the new Covenant grant? God has ſignified his
willingneſs to admit of a conference with thee here, and to put it upon thy
Conſcience, thy ſelf being Judg, touching the equality of his ways,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.3, 7. What incouragement more wouldeſt thou have, or what
aſſurance <pb n="142" facs="tcp:33235:75"/>touching the poſſibility of thy
attaining unto favour with God, or unto Grace in order to it? If then thou
declineſt the uſe of means, or every thing of duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee, and
perſiſteſt in thoſe evils which thou can'ſt avoid, to provoke God to
withdraw his help from thee; how can'ſt thou pretend thou wouldeſt be
healed of thy Souls diſtemper, as thou ſuggeſteſt, whilſt yet thy own
Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt ſubſcribe to the righteouſneſs of Gods Judgment in
condemning thee, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> if thou accepteſt not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? What
had the fooliſh Virgins to ſay, that they have not Oyl in their
Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels? Was it not their own fault, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.9. Yea, and his
mouth was muzled, as it is in the <hi>Greek,</hi> that was challenged for not
having on the Wedding-garment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. he had nothing to ſay for
himſelf. Can'ſt thou think that thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will not reproach thee in
Hell, for ſinning againſt real mercy and kindneſs, and for thy neglect of
ſo great Salvation, if thou beeſt not converted and healed? Will not thy
non-deliverance from wrath to come, thinkeſt thou, lie juſtly at thy own
door by the Goſpel? Can'ſt thou <pb n="143" facs="tcp:33235:75"/>ſay, that thou wert
left remedileſs under the firſt Apoſtacy? No, <hi>let God be true, but
every man a liar,</hi> Rom. 3.4. <hi>God is not unrighteous, who taketh
vengeance:</hi> the worm that ſhall not dye, will one day atteſt to it.</p>
            <p>Let me then reaſſume the Exhortation, in the Apoſtles words,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>We then as workers together with him, beſeech you,
that you receive not the Grace of God in vain;</hi> comply with the offer of
accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him. Endeavour after the fear of God, and work
righteouſneſs, which are the terms of it. Man is the immediate formal
efficient of it, not God; therefore eſſay it, uſe the means to it, and
look up to God for help. <hi>I have heard</hi> Ephrahim <hi>bemoaning himſelf
thus, turn thou me, Lord, and I ſhall be turned,</hi> Jer. 31.18. ſo do
thou, and do it ſpeedily, as the Apoſtle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns in the formentioned
place, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Now is</hi> the accepted time, behold now is the day
of Salvation. So ſay I, ſet upon the work now, without delay.
<hi>While</hi> it's called to day, ſaith the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
leſt any of you be hardened thro' the deceitfulneſs of Sin, <hi>Ch.</hi>
3.13. Sin is of a charming nature, and has its ſubtil inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33235:76"/>to keep its poſſeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that of the
Preſumption of an after repentance or change, which ſhall be time enough,
is none of the leaſt of its deceits, or the leſs dangerous, when (1.) life
is its ſelf ſhort and uncertain. What a vanity and cheat then is it, to
diſpoſe of that time, which no man is ſure to enjoy, and that for the
doing a work, which if death comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he is remedileſly undone for
ever. (2.) It's not Gods method to Convert men at the laſt hour. If it were
ſo, what would become of his Glory in this world? It would invert the order
of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sick bed repentances are ſeldom true. After Relapſes do
daily evince it. One or two Rare inſtances on the other hand, are not to be,
drawn into conſequence, to ſecure men of acceptance with God at laſt, in
the neglect of his fear, and their continuance in the ſervice of the Fleſh,
the World, and the Devil, till the laſt point of time. (3.) Sin continued in,
and this change put off, argueth, the one for the preſent to be rather
choſen, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nauſeated. And then to morrow and next day is likely
to be as bad with thee, and worſe than to day. This procraſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33235:76"/>tends to further hardning in ſin; as in the Text before
named. (4.) That this Heart-change is the gift of God, in order to his Favour,
thou confeſſeſt, and inſiſts upon; why then art thou not afraid that
for thy putting off the work which he enjoyns thee to day, and not anſwering
to his preſent call and overtures of Grace, in complying with the methods of
it, that he ſhould execute his threat, and ſeal thee up to obduration? It
may be thy caſe before thou art aware of it: <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he
may be found; call ye upon him while he is near,</hi> Iſa. 55.6. <hi>then
ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me
early, but they ſhall not find me,</hi> Prov. 1.28. <hi>becauſe I have
called, and ye refuſed;</hi> v. 24. <hi>for that they hated knowledg, and did
not chuſe the fear of the Lord,</hi> v. 29. take heed that thou doeſt not
rue it when it be too late. Time may be left, and yet the ſeaſon be loſt,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 19 42.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The other branch of the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is unto all
thoſe who truly fear God, and hope to be found righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Do you
continue to walk in his fear, and more and more to abound in the fruits of
righteouſneſs; more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <pb n="146" facs="tcp:33235:77"/>in thoſe that have
been inſtanced in, which were ſo Characteriſtical in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius.</hi>
Pray alway, look to the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of all under your charge; let Gods
Name be Recorded in your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that they may be Nurſeries for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and give hopes for poſterity. Be kind, and merciful, like unto your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father. Keep up the repute of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by an exact Converſation that may be
convincing. And let it appear not ſo much in a zealous purſuit of ſome
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular walk or opinion, as in the more weighty things of the Law, wherein
all that fear God muſt be agreed, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the men of the world have
alſo ſome diſcerning, and are able to judg of a mans integrity; That they
may not be tempted to conclude, that ſtrict piety and conſcience toward
God, is a thing only verbally profeſſed, and talkt of, but no where to be
found. <hi>Peter</hi> gives an inſtance herein, of the prevalency of an
exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary walk, even in women, tho the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Veſſels. <hi>That if any
obey not the word, they alſo,</hi> i. e. <hi>their husbands may without the
word be won by the converſation of the wives; while they behold your chaſt
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation <pb n="147" facs="tcp:33235:77"/>coupled with fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.1, 2.
<hi>with the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is in the ſight of
God of great price,</hi> v. 4. ſo of Husbands alſo in their place, without
which their prayers will be hindred, <hi>v.</hi> 7. what will any mans
profeſſion amount unto, without this?</p>
            <p>Above all, if thou beeſt one who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be found faithful
with God, and be kept ſteady in the way of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, look to
preſerve thy conſcience ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to keep the fear of God always upon
thy Soul, in the ſeveral inſtances before explained, wherein it doth
conſiſt; eſpecially as it denoted an awful fixation of the eye of the
Soul on him, or regard unto him in all thou doeſt, in the whole tract of thy
life: <hi>O fear the Lord, ye his ſaints,</hi> Pſal. 34.9. this is the root
and ſpring of all obedience, and of the entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and that alone
which will infer it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. let the fear of God poſſeſs thy
Soul, ſet him always before thee, call him to Record in all that thou
undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and it will preſerve thy footſteps, that they ſhall not
halt, nor ſlide. <hi>Happy is the man that feareth alway,</hi> Prov. 28.14 or
<hi>that is in the fear of the Lord all the day <pb n="148" facs="tcp:33235:78"/>long,</hi>
ch. 23.17. <hi>He walketh ſurely:</hi> If the fear of God, (which hath alway
an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperation of love in it, as was opened) once begin to languiſh, or a
forgetfulneſs of him begins to creep upon thy Soul, ſin will ſoon invade
thee, and thou wilt fall into a decay. Thou art already wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering at the root.
Take heed of Relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>If you call on the father, who without reſpect
of perſons judgeth according to every mans work, paſs the time of your
ſojcurning here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. <hi>Perfecting holineſs in the
fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. this is the whole deſign of the Goſpel.
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. hereby is God honoured, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. and without
it, the deſign of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour were fruſtrated in his
redemption of mankind; which was to retrieve, and bring back the fear of God;
and working righteouſneſs into the world; that God might not loſe the
homage of all his whole Family on earth at once, by the Apoſtacy, 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>Once more, to inforce the exhortation, let the Argument in the
Text yet further be weighed, and conſidered. Thy accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God here
and hereafter, is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended thereon by the Goſpel. God will 
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:33235:78"/>ſecure his own Glory, and has done it, by the ſame
method that he hath done thy happineſs.</p>
            <p>Acceptance with God, as was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is a continued act; and ſo
is the condition whereon it is ſuſpended, as the Scriptures do abundantly
teſtify. It is ſo in the promiſe, with which it is Connected. <hi>There
is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them who are in Christ Jeſus;</hi> but who may
aſſume this to themſelves? <hi>they who walk not after the fleſh, but
after the ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, 2. <hi>Neh.</hi>
1.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Ch.</hi> 6.18, 19.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. ſo it is in the threat of the
Goſpel. <hi>For if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die,</hi> Rom. 8.13.
i. e. <hi>your</hi> juſtification, v. 1. ſhall be diſcontinued <hi>If we
deny him, he alſo will deny us,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.12. <hi>But if any man draw
back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him. But he that ſhall endure
to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mar. 13.13. not only the hazard
of the loſs of thy inward peace, but of thy ſoul alſo, lies at ſtake,
in caſe thou declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt from the ſear of God, or beeſt again intangled
and overcome of thy luſts, and turneſt from the way of Righteouſneſs,
and neglecteſt the holy Commandment <pb n="150" facs="tcp:33235:79"/>of God, according to
that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; <hi>but when the righteous turneth away from his
righteouſneſs, and committeth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſhall he live? All his
righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned; in his ſin that
he hath ſinned he ſhall die,</hi> Ezek. 18.24. that is, if he be not
renewed again to repentance, and amendment of life, or recovered from under his
forfeiture. Here is that fear of God called for, which was ſpoken to in the
opening of the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, namely, of his wrath in caſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
ſinning againſt him; which <hi>David</hi> was ſo concerned about,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.13. and for the guilt whereof, he had his bones broken and
conſumed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.10. and 32.4. <hi>for thine arrows ſtick
faſt in me, and thy hand preſſeth me ſore,</hi> Pſal. 38.2. <hi>There
is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh, becauſe of thine anger, neither is there
any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin. My wounds ſtink, and are
corrupt, becauſe of my fooliſhneſs,</hi> v. 3.5. Pſal. 51.8. <hi>all
thy waves and thy billows are gone over me,</hi> Pſal. 42.7. and 88.7. his
ſin had ſprung a leak, that the waters came into his Soul, as he
elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſpeaks. He might have ridden out any ſtorm from without, if
all had been <pb n="151" facs="tcp:33235:79"/>right within, had not a Capital guilt lain at
his door, a Covenant breach; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. and forfeiture of Gods
complacenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Love and Favour <hi>Iremembred God, and was troubled,</hi>
Pſal. 77 3. here was a ſad change with him, who at other times could ſay,
<hi>how precious are thy thoughts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, O God, how great is the ſum of
them,</hi> Pſal. 139.17. when he kept his integrity, v. 24.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But I have been taught, that faith alone is the condition
of the new Covenant, and conſequently, that acceptance with. God is not
ſuſpended on his fear or any works of righteouſneſs to be performed by
the creature; beſides, that the argument unto holineſs from the hazard of
Salvation, urged upon belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſeems to ſubvert the doctrine of the
Saints Perſeverance in the love and favour of God. The ſuſpenſion of
the arbitrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Gods favour, or the hidings of his Face, a Saint
may fear, upon foul miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, but not the loſs or ſuſpenſion of
accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, as if his pardon or title to life eternal could be
diſcontinued thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The former part of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wholly
reſolved into the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith <hi>only,</hi> as
being <pb n="152" facs="tcp:33235:80"/>the ſame thing with acceptance with God, and the
leading promiſe of the new Covenant, as it imports the remiſſion of
ſins, and title to life everlaſting. What a Labyrinth art thou brought
into, by thy not underſtanding the tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? I appeal to thy
own ſoul, whether when thou readeſt ſuch Scriptures as <hi>Heb.</hi>
12.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. thou canſt ſhake off the fear of deſtruction,
if thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, in caſe thou relapſeſt into ſuch ſins as there
are threatned with death? If thou canſt, ſad is thy caſe: It's not every
imperfection thou knoweſt, that by the Goſpel (however it is by the Law) is
of ſo mortal a nature.</p>
            <p>Nor doſt thou any where read in the Bible, that man is
juſtified by Faith <hi>only,</hi> or alone, preciſely taken, and without
any reſtriction; but thou mayeſt read the direct contrary, <hi>Jam.</hi>
2.24. and in other words, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3, 5. However, I hope thou wilt hold
to the common diſtinction of a <hi>working</hi> Faith; that it's
neceſſary at leaſt to the Faith that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that is, worketh by
ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all Gods Commands; that it's neceſſary to it as
Faith, that it be no <pb n="153" facs="tcp:33235:80"/>
               <hi>dead</hi> Faith, tho not <hi>qua
justificat,</hi> as <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</hi> To avoid controverſie then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in ſo momentous a point, I will come to thee on thy own Principles, if thou
wilt be true to them: I ſay, that we are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified or accepted with
God, nor do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo to be, through Faith <hi>only</hi> or alone, on our
part, (however we are agreed that it is by Chriſt alone): Thou ſayeſt
that it is not by or through that Faith that is alone in the Subject; as that
the fear of God, and working Righteouſneſs is required <hi>immediately</hi>
unto acceptance with God, or continuance in his favour, to qualifie the
perſon for it? Then, that it is ſo required only to qualifie Faith, or to
make it perfect, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.22. that it be no dead carkaſs; but ſtill
thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt not but that <hi>mediately</hi> it's indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
neceſſary to life, by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Faith whereon alone thou
ſayeſt it is ſuſpended: Accordingly then, if thou haſt no other
<hi>standard</hi> of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to meaſure thy <hi>living</hi> Faith
by, than I have before, inſiſted on to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delineate the fear of
God, and true Piety in any <hi>perſon</hi> by, the iſſue at laſt is
brought to the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="154" facs="tcp:33235:81"/>
            <p>Now then to come to the buſineſs; ſuppoſe thou
ſhouldeſt neglect the fear of God, and not bring forth the fruits of
Righteouſneſs mentioned, or relapſe into any one of thoſe groſs
wickedneſſes enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. With a
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and ſuch like, <hi>v.</hi> 21. that the fleſh
carrieth it in the combate againſt the Spirit, (which was none of
<hi>Paul</hi>'s own caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. he ſpeaks not there of the
perpetration of any groſs ſin; the thief can't ſay when he takes a
purſe, that it is no more he; that what he would not do, that he doth,
<hi>&amp;c. v.</hi> 17.20.) Suppoſe, I ſay, the government
<hi>protempore,</hi> of Grace to be ſuſpended, and ſin to uſurp the
rule and dominion for any time, notwithſtanding the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſſent
of thy mind, to the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous conrtivement, and harbouring of ſome
notorious impiety, which yet is no impoſſible ſuppoſition; if thou
lookeſt not to it, as I might give inſtances once and again, were it a
thing grateful to ſtay upon. What now wouldeſt thou think of thy condition
in ſuch caſe? Thou muſt ſay either, (1.) That the Faith which is
<hi>alone,</hi> whether it worketh, or <pb n="155" facs="tcp:33235:81"/>not worketh, (if it
be not loſt) doth continue to juſtifie thee; or that <hi>through</hi> it
rather, to ſpeak in the Scripture dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, thou continueſt ſtill
juſtified, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and meet for eternal life, tho it be no
<hi>operative</hi> Faith; which is to eat thy own words. Or, (2.) that ſuch
works of Righteouſneſs, as have been inſiſted on, or thy being
cleanſed from ſuch ſins as the Apoſtle gives a catalogue of; for the
fruits of the fleſh in its <hi>regency</hi> belong not to the <hi>works</hi>
thou meaneſt, or the holineſs or obedience which thou takeſt for
neceſſary to qualifie or <hi>inform</hi> thy working faith, as not
belonging to its <hi>eſſential</hi> Character: In the point of duty thou
holdeſt them required; but that if they be wanting, and the fleſh prevail,
yet that at the ſame inſtant of time it's no <hi>dead</hi> Faith which thou
haſt; tho it worketh not as it ſhould do, yet it doth ſo far as is
neceſſary to thy Juſtification and acceptance with God: If ſo, here
then thou ſpeakeſt out. Or, (3.) If thou haſt any miſgiving that ſuch
fruits of Righteouſneſs, brought forth in the fear of God and abſtinence
from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fruits of the fleſh, do belong to the <pb n="156" facs="tcp:33235:82"/>Character of a living working Faith, thou muſt grant, that if it be
otherwiſe with thee, or ſhould be thy caſe, thy Faith can't be it that
will ſave thee; but that at ſuch time being alone, thy title to acceptance
with God will be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and <hi>diſcontinued,</hi> which is that I
have been urging upon thee to conſider, that thy Soul lies at ſtake upon
thy obedience, as well now, as before thy reception to favour with God, (but to
the continuance I have proved that they are), which as yet remains unſhaken;
and it therefore behoveth thee to look to it.</p>
            <p>As for the other foot of the Objection, reſpecting the Saints
Perſeverance, that belongs to the Doctrine of Election, or the Decrees, which
can never run croſs to the ſtanding Law of God neither. Know then, (1.)
That ſuch is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between continuation in the fear of God, and
working Righteouſneſs, and continuance in his favour, and title to
bleſſedneſs, that he has not decreed to preſerve any one in the latter,
without the former, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. and ſo runs
his Law, <hi>Job.</hi> 15.10. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. of which before. So that
perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <pb n="157" facs="tcp:33235:82"/>in the <hi>favour</hi> of God, and his
love of acceptance, and perſeverance in <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> run parallel,
and there can be no pretence to the one without the other. (2.) We have a law
or eſtabliſhment, which God hath made with his people, touching their
preſervation and progreſs in grace, which is to be attended unto. The
diſpenſation of more grace and help in time of need, is
<hi>conditional</hi> unto them, in and by the Goſpel. There is no promiſe,
no proviſion made in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace ſtruck with man, the
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration whereof is abſolute to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any one from the
greateſt and moſt enormous ſins, nor yet from Apoſtacy it ſelf, if he
attends not to the duty preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in order to it; nor hath God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that he ſhall ſo do; Grace is in its own nature loſeable; the beſt of
men are mutable or defectible here; it's actuation, and conſervation depends
on new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from him that gave it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. which God
communicates through Chriſt, who is become the head of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
<hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0. But the diſpenſation thereof is connected in the promiſe,
with a diligent heeding and <pb n="158" facs="tcp:33235:83"/>attending on the duties
preſcribed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, which man through the talents received, and help
availing him, is in an immediate capacity unto; ſuch are watching, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. Prayer unto God, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.28. <hi>Unite my heart
to fear thy name,</hi> faith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 86.11. <hi>and take not
thy holy ſpirit from me,</hi> Pſal. 51.11, 12. To ſhake off ſloth, and
uſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11, 12. not to cater or provide for the
fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. to avoid the occaſions of evil, and abſtain
from the appearance of it, and reſiſt its firſt motions, 1
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.22. to put on and keep in uſe the whole armour of God,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6.11. and in exerciſing his Grace received, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.2.
adding thereby Grace to Grace, with all diligence, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>If
ye do theſe things, ye ſhall never fall,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
<hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>i. e.</hi> into your old ſins, <hi>v.</hi> 9. which will
blur your evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for life, or ſtain your acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the faithful are cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to take heed of
falling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. and of Apoſtacy from God
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25, 38, <hi>viz.</hi> in the diligent uſe of the means
Connected with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <pb n="159" facs="tcp:33235:83"/>of their preſervation, the
which while ſome have attended, they have been in a flouriſhing poſture
God-ward, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.12. <hi>John</hi> 3.2. whilſt other ſome have
pined away; grace in them hath languiſhed, and been ready to die,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. and they, if in a ſaved ſtate, yet ſaved ſo as by
fire, hardly, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. and who might they
thank but themſelves? all is not to be reſolved into the inevitable
conſequent of the Lapſe, or firſt tranſgreſſion. They might have
helpt it. Nor doth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of God, here alſo reſerved for the
recovery of any one after Relapſes, or preventing the ſame, in purſuance
of his hidden purpoſe, derogate at all from this his ſtanding law. No
promiſe has God made on any other terms than as afore mentioned,
<hi>Jude</hi> 20.21, 23, 24. <hi>Jam</hi> 4 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If then through any mans wilful neglect, as before, the
precept of the law of grace becomes violated, I ſay again, the Sanction or
Threat takes place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all reſpect of perſons. If ſin not only
rebels, but proceeds for any time, or in any ſingle inſtance thereof, that
is <pb n="160" facs="tcp:33235:84"/>properly againſt the Goſpel, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to Reign, or to Lord it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending the government
of Grace; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience it may be reniting; but ſerved as the Prophet was by
<hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 16.10. put in priſon for reproving him;
accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, as hath been ſaid, is that while ſuſpended, be it
in any one whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. The Law of God, as it belongs to the firſt
Covenant, condemns for every the leaſt tranſgreſſion of it, as well as
the greateſt; and the greateſt is as pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, with reſpect
thereunto, as the leaſt is, by the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. But the
Goſpel relieves none, whilſt they remain uncleanſed from
wickedneſſes, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.133. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 11. or that
violate its own proper obligation.</p>
            <p>This new Law of God is immutable, as ſtable as the Pillars of
the Heavens, and of the Earth. What it once ſaith, it always ſaith, to any
one whoſoever. It's a moſt dangerous in let to prophaneſs, to ſuggeſt
or harbour ſuch a notion, that a believer (or convert, let me add) is from
under the threat of the Goſpel, in caſe of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to its commands.
I mean the threat of eternal deſtruction, binding over the 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33235:84"/>perſon immediately to it, (or rather leaving him to the
Law; not relieving him) tho it be not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, ſave in the caſe of its
finallity. The proper penalty of the Goſpel abides indeed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the
finally impenitent and diſobedient; and then it is remedileſs. <hi>Non
eſt diſtinguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ubi lex non diſtinguit.</hi> Either the Goſpel
threats no man with Excluſion out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and of Chriſt,
for ſuch acts of ſin as thoſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. or it doth all men.
Either it never did, or ſtill it doth, after believing, as well as before.
The Law is not changed, nor hath any man a patent of Exemption from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
Goſpel Sanction; or if any have, who is there, but will put in for it?
Believers are as often cautioned in the caſe of Sin, to fear and take heed of
ruin, as others are, as hath been before inſtanced in Scripture, <hi>To look
to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they loſe not thoſe things they have wrought,</hi> 2
Joh. 8. and <hi>to hold that faſt which they have, that no man take their
crown,</hi> Rev. 3.11, 21. to fear, not the way of ſin only, but
themſelves, if they ſtart aſide into it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.22, 28. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. as belonging to the true fear of God.</p>
            <p>Neither doth all this, at all interfere with the Doctrine of
perſeverance duely ſtated, which has its riſe and foundation only in Gods
decree; the Execution whereof is regulated by his ſtanding Law, or according
to it. Gods purpoſe of beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his favour in, or continuing of it to any
one, is ſo far forth and no further, than as the ſubject ſhall according
to his Law be found meet or competent for it. Every unconverted perſon is 
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33235:85"/>condemned, notwithſtanding Gods ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to
convert, or call ſome, that they may be juſtified. So his purpoſe to
recover his elect from Apoſtacy or lying in Sin, in order to their recovery
to his favour, ſecureth none from forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof in the mean while. Nor
has he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that no elect perſon ſhall ever ſo fall as to forfeit it,
and it were well that ſome mens heads were exerciſed leſs about the
<hi>Decrees,</hi> and that they attended more to the <hi>Law.</hi> The Leper
under the law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. upon his cleanſing, atonement being made,
was in <hi>ſtatu quo;</hi> reſtored to his rights, but not before. Nor was
<hi>Peter</hi> upon his denial of Chriſt, till his particular repentance, or
his new converſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. the threat took place to put a bar
in his way unto life, if Chriſt may be believed, who expreſly had told him
that it would, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.33. and had he died without a change, (which
yet the ſeed of God remaining did propend towards) he had been undone. Whom
God elects to the end, he does to the means, which may fully ſerve to remove
that part of the objection out of the way, reſpecting the Saints
perſeverance.</p>
            <p>And for what is further inſinuated, touching believers
obligation only to fear the hiding of Gods face, or loſs of former peace, in
caſe they relapſe into conſcience-waſting ſins, It's obviated before
in the doctrinal part. What the word of God threats in ſuch a caſe, that is
it they are called to fear, and that we have proved to be eternal
deſtruction; the fear whereof is twofold, Either (1) <hi>Suppoſitive,</hi>
which is antecedent to any ſin, and is required only to awe them from it 
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:33235:85"/>or prevent it. Such was <hi>Jobs, chap.</hi> 31.23. and
<hi>Pauls,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. and ſuch ought to have been
<hi>Davids</hi> fear, and <hi>Peters,</hi> when no other motive or inducement
of the Goſpel unto holineſs, could or did hold them faſt to their duty. A
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold cord is not ſo ſoon broken. Love to God and Chriſt, is indeed
the moſt genuine ſpring of obedience, but it may alſo well conſiſt
with this fear. Nay, it's an eſſential ingredient into the whole of that
fear of God all along inſiſted on, love, I ſay, in ſincerity, is ſo,
<hi>Eph</hi> 6.24. Yea, and it muſt, under the ſame penalty of an
<hi>Anathama Maranatha,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. For, God will not leave his
goverment <hi>precarious.</hi> He knows our frame, and what is neceſſary to
us; we are not yet perfect as <hi>Adam,</hi> nay, much leſs confirmed. (2.)
Or <hi>Poſitive,</hi> this is only under ſuch relapſes as intrench on
ſincerity, and is neceſſary in order to a recovery from under them; and
imports the ſenſe of preſent <hi>actual</hi> danger of deſtruction upon
the fall into, and lying in ſuch ſin. And to admit the former to be a duty,
but not this, is to grant the premiſſes, and then to deny the concluſion;
to oblige a man to fear that, which when it comes, can't hurt him, nor touch
him. </p>
            <p>It is indeed the Prerogative of God, to create Peace in any Soul,
<hi>Iſ.</hi> 57.19. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.16. and he may poſſibly for
ſome time, vail the light of his countenance from an upright walker with him,
that he may wrongfully conclude againſt himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 33.23, 24.
<hi>Iſ.</hi> 50.10. (which yet is not ordinary neither, <hi>Iſ.</hi>
33.17.) whilſt God in and by his Goſpel, ſpeaks Life and Peace to him.
And clear evidence, and ſtrong conſolation, is another <pb n="164" facs="tcp:33235:86"/>thing; accompanying not alway the being and ſincerity of Grace, but
its growth, and gradual perfection, rendring it diſcernable, <hi>Pſ.</hi>
92.14. It's not the portion of the negligent unthrifty Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
however.</p>
            <p>But our inquiry is not only about Conſolation, but ſafety; not
touching Gods arbitrary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings, whilſt his word ſpeaks peace all
that while, if the Soul could read it; but of what the Goſpel ſpeaketh; not
of what the Soul will loſe, but of what it ought not to keep, and of that
<hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> fear which is neceſſary in the point of duty to it, in
caſe of notorious decays or relapſes. Shall we think that <hi>David,</hi>
for inſtance, (not to name many others) under his blood-guiltineſs, or
whilſt in the purſuit of it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.15. was indeed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
but only wanted the ſenſe thereof in his own Soul, as ſome
diſtinguiſh? Or that the depths, or perplexity that his conſcence might
be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thereupon, before his return to God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 32.3, 5.
was only a dereliction, or on a miſpriſion, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; <hi>God</hi> not
ſpeaking peace to him, while his <hi>word</hi> nevertheleſs did? or that
the arrows of God ſhot into his ſoul, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 38.2. were not pointed
or ſharpned with any word of his? Or that his fear of the loſs of Gods
favour muſt be but infidelity added to his former ſin, and to fear where no
fear was? who dare to think this?</p>
            <p>Nor can the decree of God touching the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his elect from
ſuch relapſes, help out here, if that be thy caſe, who ever thus
objecteſt; if as yet, thou art not humbled, nor brought back to God. That
thou can'ſt not at preſent have or keep any evidence of thy acceptance with
God, all <pb n="165" facs="tcp:33235:86"/>do grant it impoſſible; and I have
aſſigned the true reaſon thereof, from the tenor of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Nor
can'ſt thou now know that thou art e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or be aſſured that thou wert
once effectually called, nor conſequently that thou ſhalt ever be renewed
again to repentance, whilſt thou art not in the way of it. Nor, which is
more, thou art not ſure to live to another moment of time in order to it;
ſay if thou beeſt aſſured of it. <hi>David</hi> was aware of this, when
he cried unto God; <hi>O ſpare me, that I may recover ſtrength before I go
hence and be no more,</hi> Pſ. 39.13. he knew he was not fit to die; nor yet
certain to live neither.</p>
            <p>Diſmiſſing then the Objection, which I have thus largely
anſwered; for that I have not found it by any fully ſpoken to, tho I have
found the conſequent of it dangerous to many that have inſiſted on it.
Let me once again exhort thee, if thou beeſt one who retaineſt the fear of
God at the bottom, to walk in his fear, and to abound in the fruits of
righteouſneſs, which is the juſt Character of one accepted with God.
Caſt not off the Authority of his Law on the one hand to aw thee to it; on
the other hand, account it not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary to lay hold of the promiſe of the
Goſpel to encourage thee therein, even that of the Text, <hi>Of acceptance
with God.</hi> Nor don't think that thou haſt no need of either; diligence in
the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Grace, is the only method preſcribed by God, for <hi>the
making thy calling and election ſure to thee,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.5, 10. No wonder
if thou beeſt at a loſs about thy condition, and afraid to appear before
God, if thou haſt been, or art neglective in the ſear of him, and the
fruits thereof, which <pb n="166" facs="tcp:33235:87"/>have been inſiſted on. Acquaint
thy ſelf with God, keep the eye of thy ſoul fixed towards him; ſet him
always before thee, in thy mind, as the rule and meaſure, the record and
witneſs, the ſcope and end, the judg and final rewarder of all thy
acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; always, that is habitually, as the Traveller thinketh of the place he
is going unto, ſo often, (tho not every inſtant of time) as not to loſe
his way at any turning; and this fear will preſerve thee in the path way of
righteouſneſs, and at length will ſafely conduct thee to
bleſſedneſs, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37.31, 37. Nor be diſcouraged at thy own
weakneſs, or the rubs in thy way. For, <hi>tho the youth ſhall faint and be
weary, and the young men utterly fall: they that wait upon the Lord, ſhall
renew their ſtrength.</hi> Iſ. 40.31. they ſhall neither faint, fall, nor
give over. I ſhall wind up all, in the words of the Preacher, <hi>Ecc.</hi>
12.13, 14. <hi>Let us hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the whole matter; fear God, and
keep his commandments; for this is the whole of man. For God ſhall bring
every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or
whether it be evil. God is no reſpecter of perſons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
